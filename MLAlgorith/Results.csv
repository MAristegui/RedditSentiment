Call that company back and if they say no call the owner

Most installers are price work, meaning they get paid more for doing more jobs in one day. That‚Äôs when you see this kind of work. 
My suggestion 
Call the guy back and make them do it right. 
And if not it‚Äôs a simple call to the BBB

"Still **FF7** on psx - Out of 6 FF games that I played (first 6 games) this one seems the most mature and interesting in terms of story. The villain is mysterious and seems to struggle himself. Cloud has his past and his psychologization. It's interesting to follow him. The other characters have their stories. It borrows from FF6 a little but it's Suikoden 2 level of writing, which means a lot considering jrpg genre but it's still not deep enough to be among the best. The gameplay is what it is in every older jrpg - nothing fun. Even so I wanted to drop FF series after 7 but hearing that later there are arguably better games than 7 maybe I'll see myself playing them. 

And **System Shock 2** \- it's too repetitive and I cannot focus on the records that explain the plot and the lore. Managing eq is just the worst, enemy respawning is bad, guns are useless, psionics are too so I use and develop wrench combat and it's quite effective.

Soft YTA. You protected your daughter and she seems to have a good relationship with the grandparents. It sounds like when you came back to the table Gp we‚Äôre already chastising your EX because he was trying to defend himself. They know he was in the wrong.

"This is tough because you are completely justified in saying what you said to him. And I can completely understand why you said it, and why it was done immediately. I cannot imagine how hurt and upset your daughter was. He deserved to hear that he is entirely in the wrong.

Perhaps the restaurant was not the place to unleash it upon him though? It seems likely that is there concern, rather than what was said? I'm the same situation I would have been so angry that likely everyone else would also hear what an awful father he was as well. And in today's world, that can mean someone has pulled out their phone, gotten it in video, and posted it to Reddit. 
If that happens, your daughter would have a lovely momento of you forever, and a reminder of what a poor father he is. 

Rarely do we ever consider these things when our children have been hurt by someone. Remember that you haven't done anything wrong. It just wasn't the greatest place to have done it in. Unless you are totally against this, I suggest giving them an apology for not waiting to chew him out in a more private setting. 

Congratulations to your amazing daughter and her team! You have been doing a great job. And it is such a wonderful thing to ensure that she has a good relationship with his parents.

I 41f have a daughter, Sam 14f with my ex husband Brian 44m. We divorced when she was 4. 

Brian made a real effort to be a good father for the first couple of years after our divorce. But then pretty much overnight he seemed to lose interest in her. He stopped coming to parent teacher nights, never came to any of her sports games and stopped asking about them, refused to pay child support (which I eventually stopped asking for, I have a well paying job), would forget to pick Sam up on days he said he would, stop asking to see her at holidays. On the rare occasions he remembered to pick her up he would try and smooth everything over by buying her expensive gifts and it worked for a really long time but it‚Äôs started to wear off now and Sam is starting to see through it. 

Sam has maintained a very close relationship with her paternal grandparents. Sam is a very accomplished field hockey player and represented our country internationally recently and it‚Äôs likely that she will be on the world championship team later this year. We returned 2 days ago and yesterday her grandparents wanted to take her and the rest of the family to lunch to celebrate. 

Brain showed up 45 minutes late, didn‚Äôt apologise. His parents were surprised, and told him to behave. As Sam was recounting her time and summaries of the matches to her grandparents Brain interjected and belittled her performance because she ‚Äòonly‚Äô scored 1 goal. Sam burst into tears and ran to the bathroom. I comforted her and she asked if we could go home, I agreed and told her to wait in the car while I got our stuff. When I returned to the table, Brain was defending himself against his parents and I snapped. I told him he was a deadbeat and recounted all of the things mentioned above and that I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Sam cuts him loose one day. Our daughter is wonderful and does not deserve to be treated like this. His parents seemed shocked as he clearly had given them the impression he‚Äôs a good father. He threw a tantrum and stormed out. I apologised and left money for half the check with his parents. 

Since then Brain has sent me several messages, and his parents texted to say they don‚Äôt appreciate the scene I caused in the restaurant. I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong but my parents agree with them, so maybe I did. AITA?

"Definitely NTA as pertaining to your question, I think you had a right to air your grievances, especially after he made your daughter cry, in public. I don't understand why his parents are reacting negatively to you in these circumstances, I don'tthink that makes them great grandparents at all..

However, I don't think you are being fair to your daughter by pushing the back child support claim onto her when she turns 18. You should be handling this, especially since you're a lawyer as you keep repeating. Why would you want to put your daughter in that awkward position? Do you think they will come out the other side with a great relationship after its done? 

Put your big girl panties on and get her money for her. She has college and life to deal with after she turns 18 and shouldn't be responsible for cleaning up your mess. Y-T-A for this.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

With a big ""BUT"", you should not have caused a scene at the restaurant. I realize you are frustrated with him and see what his actions are doing to your daughter. But to do that in such a public way ends up really making yourself look bad and taking the spotlight off how your ex has been acting. One thing I will very much like to make sure to say is be careful what you say around your daughter. My parents got divorced when I was about 7 and some of the crap they said about each other in front of me was not good. Your daughter is now old enough she can think for herself and make decisions as to whether she wants to have contact with her father. Allow her to do that. As she gets older and becomes an adult there will be many important moments in her life (graduation from school, getting married, etc.) and she is going to have to make some tough decisions. 

In terms of your former in-laws, I would set up a meeting with them in a neutral place and apologize for causing the scene (in Asian cultures this is calling 'saving face""). Tell them that was not your intension. Let them know about your frustration and the disappointment your daughter is going through. They have to be informed what is REALLY going on since their son is clearly lying through his teeth. Then let them decide how they want to handle it. Also reassure them they can see their granddaughter whenever they want. 

It sounds like your daughter is one heck of an athlete. Good luck to her and her team.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Well, we didn‚Äôt know. `Cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn‚Äôt even list us overdue for a week. 

Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin‚Äô. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it‚Äôs kinda like `ol squares in battle like a, you see on a calendar, like the battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark nearest man and then he‚Äôd start poundin‚Äô and hollerin‚Äô and screamin‚Äô and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn‚Äôt go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he‚Äôs got lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll‚Äôs eye. When he comes at ya, doesn‚Äôt seem to be livin‚Äô. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin‚Äô and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin‚Äô and the hollerin‚Äô they all come in and rip you to pieces. 

Y‚Äôknow by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don‚Äôt know how many sharks, maybe a thousand. I don‚Äôt know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin‚Äô chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, bosom‚Äôs mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. Bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended. Well, he‚Äôd been bitten in half below the waist. 

Noon the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He‚Äôd a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper, anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened? Waitin‚Äô for my turn. I‚Äôll never put on a lifejacket again.

You can get asbestos test kits at Home Depot or other hardware stores and do the test yourself. If it comes back negative then grind away and I recommend a wet sanding as it will turn to sticky glue otherwise.  Also a wet sanding will eliminate the dust as you don‚Äôt want to be breathing it, asbestos or not.  A flooring professional can help with this‚Ä¶ If it comes back positive, then you have a few options that will differ based on disposal options in your area.  

If you have no interest in preserving the hardwood floor, I would just tear it up ‚Äî taking proper precautions if asbestos‚Äî and replace with 3/4‚Äù OSB.  This will be faster and more cost-effective than sanding it off.

If it‚Äôs not too rough or uneven and not asbestos, you could just leave it and lay pad/ carpet on top.  Personally I would still remove if it were in a place I was renovating.  These old petroleum based products emit fumes/ toxic crap over time.

Edit‚Äî also want to add that there are chemical mastic removers, some are organic/ natural like the degreaser stuff made from grapefruit or oranges.  There are ways to scrape this up without sanding..  but all labor / cost intensive compared with just tearing out that floor.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

My brother and my future SIL will have a destination wedding in the Philippines. And they wanted us to fly in 2 days prior to their wedding day. However, they're not paying for any of our flights, hotel, food and etc.

My girlfriend grew up in the Philippines and moved to the USA at 13 (She's 27 now), but haven't visited her home country at all. She has told me she wanted to visit the country to pay respects to her late grandparents and to see the beaches again.

Well, since we're there, we planned to extend our stay for another week or two after my brother's wedding. And during that time, I plan to pop the question (we've talked about marriage, and she gave me to okay sign to propose).

I was dropping off some stuff to my brother and future SIL, and my brother joked about me getting married. I then mentioned to him that I plan to propose in the Philippines. I explained that we're extending our stay in the country and staying at a different island after the reception.

My brother was thrilled, and promised to not let the beans spill. However, my future SIL overheard the conversation and screamed at me to not do that. That the trip to the Philippines was all about their wedding, and I will be a major asshole if I proposed.

My brother chimed and said I won't be an asshole,  and it's not like I'm proposing at their wedding/reception. And might as well make use of the travel.

FSIL said that it would be taking away the attention from their wedding.

"Skyrim Experience: 

Step 1: play vanilla Skyrim as a stealth archer, telling yourself to not enter the mods rabbit hole and experience the game as Todd intended.

Step 2: Get bored of the current character around level 25, without completing most of the main quest.

Step 3: Begin a new playthrough as a mage. Install a few mods this time, just quality of life things like SkyUI, bug fixes and better pacing for the quests.

Step 3: Have a ton of fun as a mage the first few levels, actually taking your time this playthrough to do side quests, talk to NPC, read the lore, immerse yourself.

Step 4: Hit level 12, start dying to everything and realize that vanilla magic sucks. Consider making another character and coming back to stealth archer.

Step 5: Search for ""just a few more"" mods to improve magic scaling instead. End up installing dozen of various mods that improve features you never even use.

Step 6: Boot the game. You decide you still don't want to play as a mage because trauma is too strong, and consider coming back to stealth archer. Play for a moment, stop.Try another of these ""alternative beginnings"". Then another. 

Step 7: More mods. Don't play the actual game.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

I can play Oblivion as a Mage and never directly kill an enemy, as a thief and never use a melee weapon, as a warrior and never use magic.

This can also happen for other reasons like high humidity, wood being wrapped in plastic or having something sitting up against it, roof not being installed for many months if new construction, water damage if the home was already built, etc. It is not uncommon to find mould on interior framing like this.

"I know a family who was in the process of building a big beautiful house (in a different state) when Covid hit. It was just about this much of the way finished when the world shut down and everyone had to pack up and abandon ship. Immediately this was her biggest concern and fear, especially while living far enough away that they could not go check on the home themselves or make any sort of provisions or assessments in person. We weren‚Äôt even able to leave our homes, let alone states. Forget about flying. No one can work, so they couldn‚Äôt find anyone who would even go half-ass water proof it for them with some plastic or tarps. Then winter. Then supply chain shortages and inflation causing jacked up prices for materials/forced changes in design plans. Then more Covid. It was a nightmare. Long story long: desperation, uncertainty & fear mixed with distance & pandemic obstacles, financial issues, timeline setbacks and shady builders doing whatever they can to finish the jobs they were forced to abandon for months, leaving many exposed to the elements = recipe for disaster. Fast forward to now- full blown ongoing law suit with contractors & builders because as soon as they finally moved in, they all started getting sick. Extremely sick. Classic mold toxicity symptoms. They busted out a few walls to discover their worst fears. The entire frame of their brand new, very expensive, long awaited home looked like this. Every piece of lumber. And it had quickly spread into insulation, drywall and everywhere else. They had a company come in and do testing and multiple different mold strains were throughout including the carpets, the vents, mattresses, even their clothes & blankets. Truly disturbing and horrifying to go through. Spending your life savings on finally building your dream home. Planning your whole life around this build/move. Putting all that time and energy.

"Firstly... I did water restoration and mold remediation in structures. This is surface growth from the lumber either being left out in the elements before being installed, or after it was installed. Since the building will most likely have HVAC to maintain a proper environment to disallow further growth it shouldn't be an issue. However, what were sometimes contracted to do was to remove this surface growth. Most commonly found on prefabbed trusses that have sat in the elements next to the building waiting to be installed, the surface growth is not so easily removed by blasting soda at the installed lumber removing the growth. This was done for the owner's peace of mind and nothing more.

In any situation dealing with growth, it matters how long things are left wet. If things are dry then things are fine. Remove growth where it's necessary, possible, and reasonably cost effective. This growth seen on the lumber will be behind the walls, closed up, and remaining dry, will literally do nothing. I'm confident saying that this will not cause issues. It won't rot the wood if the wood remains dry inside the wall. Remaining dry the growth dies. Although, since it's new construction, it's very accessible, and super easy to just remove the growth, just remove it and then close the walls up.

Using microban or something similar, one can apply the solution, scrub off the surface growth, and dry out the structure before installing drywall. Because it's growth air movement with blowers shouldn't be used, and after scrubbing and leaving for a few days (depending on the climate outside the situations may vary and the course to ensure the structure is dry could vary drastically as well) you could paint some killz2 on the areas of lumber and then close the walls.

Doing nothing and closing the walls, assuming the wood is not wet, wouldn't bother me in my home, but it doesn't seem like it would be much to just clean it and then continue with the build. Dealing with trusses with surface growth is where we usually did the soda blasting. It was far less common to see it in the lumber used for walls. If I'm wrong in my diagnosis, and this growth is from some really odd flooding, it depends on how long the structure stays wet, where the longer the worse obviously.

This, in and of itself, would not cause future issues. You're always going to need water and a wet environment for future issues to arise when talking about growth. If the house floods in the next 10 years, or a pipe bursts in the next ten years, the growth you see with change absolutely nothing with respect to the aforementioned fictitious future hypothetical flood. Quite frankly, the majority of homes have this type of surface growth somewhere on the lumber within the structure, at around the same prevalence you're seeing one the structure in the pics.

"Mold inspector of 20 years here. This is very common on building sites, (especially in the Pacific Northwest). It‚Äôs usually caused from building in the wet winter months and not having the wood dry out fast enough. As long as the wood  remains wet, the mold will continue to grow.  If the wood is completely dry before adding insulation and sheet rock, the mold goes back to being dormant until water returns.   Mold absolutely needs a source of continual moisture in order to keep growing. Usually in these situations, we apply some sort of a mildicide (DONT use bleach) to all the exposed framing once it‚Äôs dry. You can either encapsulate it using a primer/sealer, sand it away or encapsulate it using insulation and drywall. The only way, the spores will affect the general air quality of the finished house is if you have significant amounts of airflow coming from inside those wall cavities.

"I don‚Äôt know the old I‚Äôve had a lot older that worked fine. Your basic cleanup, for that would be to unscrew and clean out the strainer on the front of the pump. Then I would check the chlorinator. I think you‚Äôve got one in the back there. Then I would re-prime the system, which should just be a matter of turning pump on, and letting it run until system quits making a lot of noises. And then turn it off, set the filter to backwash and turn it on for the recommended length of time. The instructions should be on the label on the front. Turn pump off after backwash time then select rinse and run recommend again. Turn pump off, select filter and turn the pump back on. To rotate the top handle on the filter, push it down hard move it and let it pop back up. Never try to move it or even do anything to the system with the pump running.     If you‚Äôre going to maintain the pool yourself, I do and I think it‚Äôs easy now. Read some articles about your pool type, and how to care for it, how to balance the water chemistry levels and a basic understanding of how they work so you know what does what and why. When I replaced all my pool equipment, I chose a sand filter again. I‚Äôve done the run cost math. I‚Äôve seen the work load. I like sand filters. You just have to use a bit of pool clarifier to give him a hand with the really fine stuff and I mean really a very small amount or you‚Äôll overdo it. I probably only less than quarter ounce at most before waiting for the effect. Unless the pool is exceptionally filthy because I‚Äôve completely let it go over the winter and still won‚Äôt add much at a time after the 1st 1/2oz. I generally only use the test strips for chlorine and an idea of where the pool is balanced and then every month in the summer to three months in the winter I‚Äôll let the pool store check a water sample and sell me everything I need with the quantities to fix it. I also supplement the chlorine with a good quality, concentrated algicide, 1 ounce every one two weeks seriously reduces the need for chlorine. Note everything I‚Äôve quoted is for a 5000 gallon in-ground caged, Mar-cite  pool In south Florida and quite low use. The previous house with the 8000 gallon uncaged and nearby trees regularly used was an awful lot more of a headache.

Pool Stores may try to sell you unnecessary stuff if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. Fortunately, we have a little private owned pool store and they have never really seem to stay in the wrong. The larger chains have often tried to sell me stuff I didn‚Äôt need, I use them if they have some thing that I otherwise couldn‚Äôt get from my small store. Also my small store will also sometimes match a price of something I found online or come close with something of better quality and they just order it for me. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to make friends.

Finally, I will have on hand and use those shock bags. Very occasionally the four or five in ones if I‚Äôve got some algae etc. but usually just the ones that shock with basically powdered chlorine and nothing else, It‚Äôs quite easy to end up with too much stabilizer and they are nice to have around if you can‚Äôt get to the pool store for chlorine. Also recommend making an attempt to keep your pump dry, I cut the side and bottom out of a plastic cat litter bucket. And if you don‚Äôt put some thing on your pressure gauge glass the sun will fog it to unreadable overtime. It certainly does this in South Florida. I just sit little plastic container for the gasket grease on it.

it‚Äôs a learning process and it gets easier.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Is your pool clean now, or is it a disaster? If it‚Äôs clean now, it‚Äôs going to be much easier for you to learn-on-the-go how to fight the pump battle, versus fighting the water battle and the pump battle both.  Source: was a pool tech/pool boy in my misspent youth for both residential and commercial pool owners. 

Pool maintenance breaks down into two pieces: your water and water treatment/chemical needs, and the physical pump system that circulates the water. I will give you a brief run down of the pump maintenance cycle, but be warned this is the easy part! Getting the hang of the chemical balance you need for your water is much more difficult as it varies widely from pool to pool. 

What you have there is a sand filter and pool pump combo. The sand filter the big drum looking thing with the lever on top. The pump is the little box with the see through top nestled in the pipes, just to the left of filter. 

Your sand filter will has one inlet and two outlets. The inlet sources water from your skimmers and bottom drain. This should be the single pipe coming in from the right, by I can‚Äôt tell by your pic. You can tell what the inlet side is because if you can follow the line to the pump. Upstream of the pump there will be one or more pvc valves on the pipes coming into the pump inlet. These valves allow you to close each of the bottom drains and the skimmers off individually (which creates more suction on the ones that are left open, more on this later). 

One outlet line will recirculate the water back to the pool, and out of the jets. 

The other outlet is your waste line. You‚Äôll want to figure out where this one comes back to the surface on your property because you will waste out water as part of regular maintenance and sometimes people put them where they will damage a driveway or foundation. 

One of those grey boxes will have a master on/off switch with a timer. You use this to set the number of hours your pool pump and filter system runs during the day. During summer, you‚Äôll run the pump way more - like 8-16 hours per day depending on your pool. During winter, a lot of pools can get by with 6, 4 or even 2 hours of run time per day.

Ok, so your sand filter is filled with sand. Literally, it‚Äôs just fine sand about the consistency of playground sand. Your sand will need to be replaced every 5 years is so. It‚Äôs an easy if laborious job to do yourself if you are so inclined. 

The cadence of basic pool system maintenance goes like this for good times (spring and summer) of the year. (You‚Äôll need to do these 2 or even 3 times more frequently during fall and winter, depending on your pool). 

Your filter system helps prevent two things in your pool - accumulation of sand and debris, and algae growth. They are not unrelated, and more leaves and debris cause more algae blooms that are harder to control than they would be otherwise. 

Check and empty your skimmers at least daily; sometimes twice daily depending on time of year and your pool.

Blowing off the pool deck daily or even every other day is a 30 second investment that keep your pool cleaner than any single other thing you can do. 

Brush the walls, floor, and steps of your pool using the pool brush at least once per week, but preferably twice a week. This is vital to keeping algae growth and sand accumulation on the sides and bottom of your pool at their absolute minimum. For a vinyl pool the alternative to regular brushing is swimming in it every day and making it a point to run your hands and feet over as much of the liner as possible to break any algae loose off the walls. A gunnite liner simply must be brushed - algea really likes to hide in the pores of the concrete. If you don‚Äôt brush regularly you will use about 3x more chemicals - which gets expensive and can ruin a vinyl pool liner - and still end up with an algae bloom every month.

Stop the pump system and take the clear cover off the pump and clean out the inner and outer pump basket every 1-2 weeks. Typically you just look down through the clear top and if you can see debris in the pump baskets, clean them out.

If the water drains out of the pump basket when you take the clear cover off, it means your pump is higher than your pool. This means you will need to stop the pump when you check the basket, and you will need to reprime the pump before restarting it. Repriming the pump is easy - just get a bucket of water out of the pool and pour it in the basket to fill the pump and the nearby pipes up with water; very quickly put the clear cover back on the pump to keep the water from draining out of the basket space again. Once the top is in place it closes the system and the water will stay where it is. Repriming is easy and very important so don‚Äôt overlook it if your pump drains out when you open the pump basket. Pool pumps will overheat very quickly if they are run dry. Worse, often times the pump cannot get enough suction going with air alone to move water from downhill up to the pump. This shortens the life of your pump enormously or it straight up causes your pump to burn out! 

If water starts flooding out of pump basket when you take the top off, your pump is lower than your pool. If this happens, leave the pump on when your are checking and cleaning the pump basket to keep it from flooding the entire area while you have the pump top off.

In either case, you take the top off the pump, clean both the inner and outer pump baskets, reseat them, and then recap the pump basket with a clear top. You need to make sure of two very important things - the o-ring didn‚Äôt fall off the clear top, and you don‚Äôt overtighten the clear top (which will pinch the oring and not only cause leaks but stretch it out and ruin it).

Every 4 weeks you need to backwash your sand filter to clean it. You usually do this just after vacuuming the pool for the month. Stop the pump system with the master on/off. Set the lever on top of the sand filter to ‚Äúbackwash.‚Äù This runs water backwards through the sand filter to clean out the accumulated debris caught in the filter. Turn on your pump system and backwash 2-3 minutes. (Note water will be pumped out the waste outlet during this, so locate where that waste line comes out on your property!). Turn off pump system, set the lever to rinse, turn pump back on and run on rinse for another minute. Turn pump back off, reset the lever to the original setting for normal operation, and you are good to go. 

The last bit is vacuuming, which you will need to do every 2-4 weeks depending on the pool. You‚Äôll should have a pool a vacuum with a hose in the equipment pile. The vacuum goes on the pole, the end of the hose is shaped so you can plug it into the inlet line at the bottom of a skimmer once you take the skimmer basket out. Note you can use the valves on the inlet side of the filter/pump to shut off the other skimmers and/or the bottom drain to get more suction to your vacuum. It‚Äôs all about finding a combo that works for your pool -  shut off too much, the pump will place so much suction on the vacuum it sticks to the floor of the pool. To little, and the vacuum won‚Äôt have enough suction to pick up debris.

Typically you clean your pump basket and run a monthly backwash cycle right after your monthly vacuum. Vacuuming sucks a lot of junk directly into the filtrations system, ie the pump basket and the sand filter.

I understand your reasoning and applaud you for wanting your granddaughter to have a relationship with her mother but I think you are missing some points

1. This is the same woman who abandoned your son with a child and ran away from her responsibilities. 

2. You don't know what she has been upto till now. She can be absolutely perfect or she can be a wreck house. Drugs, criminal activity, her previous guy these are the questions that needs to be answered before letting her to meet a child.

3. Why now. Why was she absent for so long and how come she has a sudden change of heart.

4. And probably the most critical. You son is scared. It may be irrational but he is not only hurt but scared that all of the this woman turns up what she wants, maybe bring hope to his child and then again abandon them or try to take the daughter.

5. And last how is it going to affect the child. What are you guys gonna tell her where her mother was. Why did she never showed up in school, when she was I'll etc.

You were not trying to help him calm down and think clearly, you were trying to push him into talking with the deadbeat mother.

If you REALLY cared about your grand daughter and son, you‚Äôd be putting them first.  A parent who left once and disappeared for FIVE YEARS has no right to just show up out of the blue and get what they want.  Protect your son and grand daughter.  You‚Äôre so hyped up over getting the fairytale ending of mother and daughter reuniting that you‚Äôve become blind to reality.

Think of how much anguish and pain your single-or arent son has suffered through - alone - all this time.  The hurt and resentment he likely has for the woman who nope‚Äôd the fuck out of responsibility and ABANDONED her own child.

His ex abandoned both your son and their daughter to be *with another man.* 

Funny that you have no problem rolling out excuses for *her* actions and behavior and yet it seems you have little to no empathy for your son. It kinda blows my mind, to be honest. It seems to me that you're more on *her* side than his. Your son likely sees this and feels some kind of way about it, and who can blame him? First his ex betrays and abandons him and then his own *mother* sides up against him. Real nice. 

Your son doesn't need to grow up. That's exactly what he did from jump street. YOU, however, need to learn a thing or two about loyalty.

You say she's not a bad girl, a good girl doesn't cheat and run away with someone else, especially when they have a kid, you say she's not evil or malicious but how do you know that you don't know her anymore.

"YTA.  
This woman didn't just leave her boyfriend/your son. She left her child. Not any custody, no visitation, just no-show for 5 years (from the little girl was 3 to now, it seems). That's not something you can just forget. She can't just decide to randomly pop up in their lives again, and you have no idea about her intentions or sincerity or remorse.

What if she suddenly disappears from the kid's life again? How heartbreaking and devastating would that be? What if she keeps turning up and then disappearing every couple of years? Do you have any idea how much that will destroy that little girl's ability to trust other people? That's so, so much worse than being alone with a single parent who she can depend on.

Even if the ex doesn't have any ill intentions, she might not realize how big the responsibility is. She might not want to hurt the child, but still end up hurting her. You son is right for protecting his daughter.

If the ex truly is remorseful, has grown up and wants to be a part of the little girl's life, then she should not just turn up unexpectedly. She should contact the father/your son first, get the court involved, prove that's she's trustworthy and then slowly introduce the daughter to her and let them have more and more visitation - on the daughter's terms and with guidance from professionals.

She can't just show up like nothing happened. And you can't just expect your son to be calm and cool about this. She abandoned him and their daughter, she hurt them deeply. Of course he can't just forgive and forget that, and of course he's afraid she's going to do the same thing again.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

In fact, why are you assuming that someone who left their partner and child, stayed out of touch  then just rocked up unannounced when they were bored will be offering nothing but good? Is it because she has a uterus and is, therefore, an automatically better parent than your son?

"I'm leaning towards YTA.

Your son's ex-girlfriend is an adult who abandoned her child. She left for years.

When you abandon a child, you don't get to just turn up as and when you please. The adult decision, at that point, is to prioritise the welfare of the child. If she wants to open a line of communication, it should be done in a public space without the child present so that everything can be discussed. I, personally, would advise your son seeks legal advice to open correct channels of communication.

You seem to be assuming a lot about this person feeling remorseful, but as someone who comes from a family where drug addiction and child abandonment runs rife, it causes so many problems that really need to be addressed and assessed.

I don't really understand why your empathy in this situation seems to be pointed more at her than your son who clearly stepped up to the plate in a massive way as a single parent.

Edit: I should add - If this is based in the US, I believe a court would factor in abandonment. In many states, I think it's only a year of no contact from a parent for it to class as abandonment. Legal advice is definitely what OP's son needs in this situation, as well as help to open communication channels that prioritise his child's welfare.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

The woman who abandoned her own child - your grandchild - left your son to do all the adulting and parenting by himself. This doesn't make her a kind person. You say she is not evil or malicious, but her actions speak volumes. It's been at least 5 years. What could she say now that takes away all the hurt and pain she has caused your son and your grandchild? 

He can refuse this. How do you know she isn't being malicious? How do you know she is remorseful? All we know is she showed up and knocked on his door. She could be asking for money, a place to crash, wanting to take her child away from the only parent the kid has known. He is under no obligation to entertain anything his ex says. 

You are not trying to help him think clearly. You obviously want them to have some kind of relationship and you want your picture of a happy little family back. Please let go of this vision.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"YTA. I think your intentions are good, but there are some things I think you should consider before giving the your granddaughter‚Äôs mother your vote of confidence to just jump back in her life. 

I worked in child welfare for 5 years. In my state, legal grounds to permanently terminate parental rights was 6 months of no contact/support. It‚Äôs considered abandonment. If it weren‚Äôt for your son being an amazing father, chances are she wouldn‚Äôt have any rights to see her child at all for the remainder of her childhood. Let that sink in. And just because her rights weren‚Äôt terminated, doesn‚Äôt mean she has the right to see her daughter now. Your son knows what‚Äôs best for his daughter and, being the sole active parent, he‚Äôs 100% entitled to decide what‚Äôs in her best interest.

Here are some things your son is probably considering: Does his daughter even want contact with her mother? Will the mother be a steady and reliable figure in her life? Her track record obviously isn‚Äôt good. Is he setting her up for disappointment whenever they make plans, will she even show up on a consistent basis? Does she have any issues related to drugs or alcohol? Is the mother in a toxic or abusive relationship? Does she have mental health concerns? He has a duty to keep her safe and it sounds like he‚Äôs doing everything in his power to protect his daughter. With time he may consider some type of contact appropriate, but her just showing up at his door and expecting to be ‚Äúmom‚Äù again is ludicrous.

Your son is being protective of his daughter. You are lucky to have a son that is such a great father. This is understandably very difficult for him. Give him the support he needs.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"YTA. She abandoned him with a 3 year old, left for 3 years to enjoy her life stress free with no responsibilities and to be with another man. SHE DESERVES NO RESPECT.

Her possibly taking his daughter away for time when she couldn‚Äôt be bother to care for her previously? For all you know she could be returning because new boy dumped her and got bored of her",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"This sounds really odd... like you and gf talked before she went to see your son, as if she knew it would be easier to have you advocate for her, so that now he's feeling pressured from his own family. I can't figure out how else you could know and defend her litany of excuses. That's pretty manipulative of her if that's the case, and I'd like to think you're just incredibly simple in your good natured-ness that you'd be that gullible to force this upon your son, and not equally manipulative. ü§®

Either case, it's not your place to force him to do something he's not comfortable with. He'll talk to her when he's ready, if he's ever ready.That's for a hard working father with a 3rd grade child to figure out. Neither one owes that woman a damn thing.  It is NOT for you to demean him on behalf of an abusive, manipulative, irresponsible, selfish, disrespectful, flaky ex. It IS for you to recognize that he already ""manned up"", to shut up with your personal feelings and opinions, and just be supportive and be there for him emotionally. He could have abandoned his responsibility and you'd have made all the ""not ready for adulting"" excuses on his behalf too. Instead he did what he had to do and tried to build a family. He didn't break up a home and abandon his 3 year old for some other woman, did he? He's not answering you because your allegiance is with her and knows that anything he tries to say to you will be shut down and demeaning in defense of her. He now feels like he has to defend himself against two instead of one. Just like she abandoned her child and her relationship for a fickle fling, you've done the same to him, which really, really, really sucks. My heart breaks on his behalf since yours won't.

No, she can't. And now she wants to come back and play mommy? To get back together with him? I am betting the only reason she came back is because the new boy toy dropped her.

You should have calmed him down, let him vent, let him reach a peaceful place again and slowly introduced the idea that he could perhaps come up with a set of boundaries and rules to give the mom a chance to prove herself. This little girl does not need a mom. This mom wants her little girl. Those are not the same. Keeping her away from the child for now is absolutely the safer plan compared to making them meet. That's why an eventual compromise of letting her prove herself is likely the best middle ground.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

You could have been glad that he trusts you enough to turn to you, instead of talking down to him like being upset under these extremely stressful circumstances is some kind of failing.

Yes, being cheated on and deserted like that is traumatic and he probably never properly dealt with it at the time as he had to try to minimise the impact on his daughter.

She left your son to raise their child *alone*. Their daughter doesn't even *remember* her. But now she's back and should be forgiven because she was scared? What about your son?

Why does she get this benefit of the doubt? If it's because she's a woman, I've got news for you; women are just as capable of doing shitty things as men. This woman *abandoned* her child. *Abandoned*. 

I would not accept a deadbeat dad back into my child's life and neither would I accept a deadbeat mum. I hope your son applies for full custody so that she can't just abandon her daughter again when it gets too tough.

"NAH, and before anyone comes for me, I have a three sided perspective on this. 

  First, I was abandoned by my bio father when I was born ( he had undiagnosed mental issues), and I would have given  ANYTHING for him to have come back before he died so I could meet him, but after he got help for his issues he was too ashamed to come back and thought I would want nothing to do with him.  I didn't get to know anything about him until after he passed and his widow found me.  It still hurts to know that I didn't get a chance to know my father because he was worried  I hated him for leaving and wanted nothing to do with him.  If I had ever learned he came back and my mom turned him away I would never forgive her for not giving me the chance to decide for myself if I wanted him in my life.
  
  Second, my son's father left as soon as he knew I was knocked up, he didn't want to be a dad, and that's ok.  I have reached out a couple of times in the past 13 years to let him know that if he ever changes his mind I would never stop him from trying to know his son because I know how important it can be to a child. 

 Third, my step kid's mom walked out on them and yet their dad has always said that if she wants to come back in their lives he would allow it as long as they want it, because ultimately we just want the kids to feel as loved as they possibly can.

 Could the conversation have gone a bit smoother, yes, but there are valid points to what you said.

My son is 26 with a beautiful 8 year old daughter. He and his ex girlfriend were both 18 when she came around, and she was definitely a little surprise.
Despite the circumstances, my son really stepped up. He got a good job and eventually got them a nice apartment.
They were together for almost three years, but she just wasn't ready to be a mother, and she ran away with some other boy. She wasn't a bad girl, she just wasn't prepared to be an adult. This devistated my son, but he found his feet. My granddaughter was still very young, so she never had strong memories of her mom.
He's been a single father since then, and it's still a sore spot for him.

Yesterday my son comes by my house incredibly upset saying that his ex girlfriend came to see them. She said she was sorry for leaving like she did and just wanted to see him and her daughter. 
My son said he told her not to come back and shut the door on her. He was practically in tears telling me this.
I told him he needed to calm down and act like an adult about this. She wasn't asking for anything but to talk, and the least he could do was hear her out. I tried to tell him that he couldn't refuse his daughter a chance to connect with her mom, how good this could be for all of them. But he was a complete mess, he couldn't even talk to me, just stormed out. I've called, but he won't answer.

I understand how hard this is for him, but this isn't some evil, malicious woman, and it sounds like she's coming from a place of real remorse. I'm was just trying to help him think clearly, but it feels like he just won't be rational here and it's starting to affect his and his daughters life.

No, what you're suggesting isn't the rational thing. It's one thing to entertain a deadbeat mother/fathers interest in their child as far as it will go, but their relationship is fuckin dead.

He is hurt and betrayed, and probably feels like she gave up his 20's to raise a child alone after her mother took off and left him with all the responsibility.

So mom gets to just, waltz away and live her best, free life but your son has bared the brunt and chaos since grandkid was born. 

8 solid years of crying, pooping, doctors, teachers, family, chaos, child raising, sleepless nights, all the food, snacks, meals, park trips, outtings, little league, stress, tears, angry screaming, loneliness and patental isolation. Which, a LOT of people dont frickin recognize. And thats not even scratching the surface. God forbid grandkid is Neurodivergent. 

Your telling me, Im 30 yrs old. And if my Bio-dad waltzed in like nothing ever happened, I should just accept that? F you Op. And F your way of thinking. 

Would it be cool for the kids mom to do right BY THE CHILD & HER FATHER, by making a relationship? Sure. Thatd be nice. But how DARE you invalidate your sons emotions. He has every right to feel how he does. And you, grandparent dont get to judge. 

Your sons an incredible human being. Stepping up at 18 when the MOM wouldnt. Thats huge. And you should be so much more proud and understanding of your son, how awful of you. I just.... this one struck a cord and I am LIVID for your son on your behalf. Because, obviously to you, his efforts mean nothing as long as 'mom' comes back right?

"YTA and an idiot. Apologize, support your son's decisions and hope that your son forgive you or you'll lose both him and your grand daughter in favor of the woman who abandoned them. I shook my head so hard reading what you said to your son...",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"I think your intent was good, your message was iffy and your timing was terrible.

**Intent**: Clearly you want your granddaughter to have healthy relationships with both of her parents and for your son to have a healthy co-parenting relationship with his ex. It's an admirable goal, and if his ex is willing to put in the work, it may be possible. It also seems like maybe you were trying to put a positive spin on things to calm your son down and that you were actually trying to be supportive and not dismissive.

**Message**: The problem with what you said is you're only looking at the upsides of this. Yes, if your son's ex is emotionally healthy and ready to put the work in to regain the trust of her daughter and your son, then this could be a good thing. However, you seem to have forgotten that there are some very real dangers to this. If your son's ex leaves again, or if she guilts her daughter for not being instantly ready to love her unconditionally, or if she wants to take primary custody of your, any of this could put a lot of emotional damage on your granddaughter. Yes it could be good like you said, but it's still something that has the potential to be harmful and needs to be handled very delicately. It may not be all gloom and doom like your son was portraying, but it's also not all sunshine and roses like you were saying. Also, by saying he needed to be a grown-up, you were implying that he was acting childish simply by expressing emotions, which is a terrible message to send.

**Timing**: Here's where you really went off the rails. This is a huge emotional upheaval for both your son and your granddaughter. He has the right to be upset about it, to be angry that she walked out 5 years ago and thinks she can just walk right back in without repercussions. I am decades older than your son, and when I received upsetting news last week, it took me some time to wrap my head around it. I had to have my freak out/let all my emotions out before I could calmly think it through and plan how to deal with it. Your son came to you during this freak out period, and instead of allowing him the space to deal with his emotions, you basically told him to suck it up. That's incredibly unhealthy and a toxic view about emotions, and you owe him a huge apology for that.

What you should have done was allow him to vent as he needed to, and then start talking through possibilities with him when he was calmer. What if she is sincere, what if she's not? Both are equally likely possibilities and need to be dealt with. Most importantly, you could have been there for him as he figured out how to best support his daughter through this. Instead, you showed him that you don't support him and probably wouldn't support his daughter, all because of your rose tinted glasses view of his ex. You seem to be trying to tell your son to put his daughter first, but you couldn't manage to put your son or your granddaughter first. Do better.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"I don‚Äôt think your perspective is rational at all.

Your sons response is completely rational and fitting for the situation. His daughter‚Äôs mother gets to come and go whenever she sees fit. Maliciously intended or not, that hurts not just your son but his daughter too. 

Expressing that pain and confronting his emotions over seeing his ex-girlfriend again is completely sensible. Setting aside his feelings because you think he should be catering to her is absolutely ridiculous. We have no idea what kind of state she is in, whether she is fit to be a parent, or whether she will run off again. If your son listens to you, he might find himself in the same position with his ex abandoning her family again and this time your granddaughter would be old enough to feel the pain that would cause.

"NTA, but you require a bit more tact and nuance in how you approach the situation. What your granddaughters mother did is awful even if it is understandable, and your son is well within his right to be upset, angry and hurt. To cold call as she did also lacks tact.

Why is she now reappearing in their lives, what has she been up to since she left etc this all needs to be clear.

My sister has a wedding coming up and as all grandparents are busy, has asked if me and my fianc√© could babysit my 14 week old niece. We said yes and asked for dates so we could both take the day off work. Due to life being generally busy, I had forgotten the dates when I went to book them so I asked my mum as my sister isn‚Äôt on her phone very much. My mum told me April and so both me and my fianc√© put in a day off for April. A few days ago at lunch, I made a comment about how it won‚Äôt be long now until we look after my niece and my sister was confused as the wedding isn‚Äôt until June. My mum had given me the wrong dates.

My mum then offered us to my sister anyway and told her we would still babysit in April to give her a rest even though it‚Äôs not up to her and I explained that as I don‚Äôt need that day off now, I‚Äôd actually rather cancel it as we are short staffed at work and I‚Äôd like to save my holidays for when I really need them. My fianc√© doesn‚Äôt get a big holiday allowance so he was happy to cancel his day too so he could use it when he really needs it. Both my sister and my mum are upset at me for doing this and think I‚Äôm being unfair as babysitting would allow my sister some time to herself. 

I have told her that I will happily take my niece in June for the wedding but that I would rather not use a holiday in April to babysit if I don‚Äôt need it. She‚Äôs upset that I‚Äôm now cancelling this day instead of helping her out and I feel like an asshole. Am I?

That required that I went with her, but their dad kept them, and we made sure that all the kids felt loved and cared for.  It is a tricky balancing act.   We took turns taking the older 2 out as individuals to ensure they were cared for and got individual attention.  Thankfully she is now 11 and the other 2 are adults and they all get along and love one another.  Not excusing your parents' behavior but I can sympathize with all of you as it is a horrendous situation where you literally face losing a child and you have no control over it.

I (24 f) am engaged to jess (26 f) and want my uncle (49 m) to walk me down the aisle? Lets get into the backstory.

When I was younger I had a twin brother james who had a heart condition. My parents obviously cared about james more than me they would shower him with love and attention while I was the black sheep.

Eventually when we were 9 his condition got bad to the point where he was in and out of the hospital. My parents then shipped me off to live with my uncle and his wife sarah (46 f)

When I started living with them It was the best thing to ever happen to me. My uncle and his wife gave me love and attention something I had desired for the longest time.

Eventually my brother got better but they never came to get me back and completely abandoned me. I hadn‚Äôt seen them in 5 years.

When I was 16 they wanted contact but I didn‚Äôt My uncle pressured me into It so I did start having contact. 

Well lets fads foward into the present.

As I said before I am now engaged to jess (26 f) I recently had dinner with my dad and we were talking about the engagement. Midway into it he asked if he could walk me down the aisle. 

I laughed at him and asked him why he deserves to and reminded him that he completely abandoned me. I told him my uncle would be the one to give me away. He and my mom ended up leaving early.
 
My brother called and said I was an asshole and that my dad deserves this right. I hung up and blocked him

AITA here?

"You can have whomever you want walk you down the aisle.

That said, it is worth saying that ""extremely sick kid vs. healthy kid"" situations are complicated.

It can often feel like the parents love the sick child more. Usually parents feel terrible that the sick kid can't enjoy life the way the healthy kid does, so they try to compensate by doting more on the sick kid. They very well might have been trying to spend as much time with him before he died (which sounds like it could have been a possibility back then).

Your parents were probably aware of how you were responding to this situation and didn't want you to suffer because of all the attention they had to give to James's sickness. They arranged for you to stay with family and that usually requires quite a LOT of behind-the-scenes details that you probably never knew about, from your legal care to healthcare, guardianship, education, etc - I'd bet that your uncle and his wife were probably in contact quite a bit with your parents about you and just never told you.

Once James got better, you were already very happy with your current living situation. Selfish parents would probably just want to take you back home but I'd be willing to bet that they had a long conversation about it and figured you seemed happier where you were, and they likely didn't want to uproot your life again, especially if there was any chance of James getting sick again.

Overall, your parents likely love you very much and the way things went down FELT like abandonment but it was them trying to give you a happy life. So if that's the reality here, then what you said might feel like they are getting punished by you for doing what they thought was best.

However, all of that is just a guess based on a lot of assumptions, so you should probably have a conversation with them and lay it all out and tell them how you feel and give them a chance to say their side, as well.

You are an adult now and you're capable of understanding difficult life choices now a lot better than you could as a kid when all of this was happening, so give them a chance.

"IDK-  I relate to you, so maybe I can offer you a different perspective or just project but gonna unpack this here anyway üò¨

you say that moving in with your uncle and his wife is the best thing that ever happened to you. i think you should really think about that.

i know you missed your parents, but as someone who grew up in a similar situation as you, i wish i had some parental type figures to raise me and show me love and care about me when my parents couldn't. to teach me how to be a functioning adult instead of keeping me on hold in the house till my brother is okay. my brother was always so sick, and i have no concept of what it's like to have any guidance. everything i had to learn about life i had to learn the hard way. i'm literally just out here like a wig flapping in the wind trying to figure it out as i go.

they kept me there, at home with them, and i began to feel like a ghost in a horror movie that i didn't know i was in. i went thru all the trauma of seeing my brother go in and out of the hospital, concussions, injuries, sickness, parties stopped because my brother \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  seeing my mom sobbing as she runs out of emergency room, spending christmas by myself while my aunts and uncles took shifts to check in on me while they were in the ER for all of xmas week when I was like 4. it still affects me to this day. i had to move back home for a while after college, and when i saw the pavlov response my parents had in fear over my brother's health, i realize that they were really doing the best they could. he didn't ask to be sick. and my parent's instinct wouldn't let them not freak out when their heart is beating outside of their chest in the shape of a young child.

my brother would get into a situation that stresses me out so bad, like having a random seizure from drinking liquor, that eventually i had to move back out. i thought my parents didn't care, but eventually they told me they knew i would make something of myself, and even my brother told me that where i thought iw as the black sheep- they thought of me as the one who would carry the torch for my family. and if i'm being honest, i did that. it hurt and was lonely, but i succeeded still. by leaving and not being brought into the chaos that was my brother's world. i didn't know how my parents dealt with it all the time. the pain of loving someone so much, and also kind of hating them because they are a huge emotional liability. and i'm not even my brother's parent and i would literally suplex a mountain ox with my bare hands if anything were to threaten to harm him- that's them biology brakes. 

i don't think your parents could help it, and by time they looked up again, it was too late. they probably feel really guilty. what can they do to make it better? or do you just hate them for putting you in the basket and sailing you down to a better chance for a healthy and functional life like Prince of Egypt style. . your brother couldn't help it that he was sick- but they didn't want you to go ignored. anyway- imo i hope you can save some room for grace, but you're NTA for feeling a way about it. very unfortunate situation all around. don't think your parents also don't feel gipped having to not experience you in those 5 years either. the second half of your life, though it was painful, doesn't have to be like the first half.

how would you have preferred them to handle it? do you think maybe they might have felt guilty or bad for not being able to handle both of you? i remember my parents thinking i was more independent than i was (because I had to be) and thought it was by choice, or my personality- forgetting i was just a kid trying to survive too.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Woof.. there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here. 

First of all, your parents didn‚Äôt care ‚Äúmore‚Äù for your brother. They loved you too and just as much. But in a situation like this the other kid can be put behind. My wife works with families specifically in this situation to help children in comparable situations. Be it their siblings or parents, sickness or handicaps. It‚Äôs a hard job with lots of emotions but she runs into situations like these so often. 9 times out of 10 the parents regret what they‚Äôre doing they just don‚Äôt see another way.

I get your anger. Me and my wife both grew up in a family with a terminally sick parent and things happened the took me till well in my 30s to understand. Let alone forgive. Thankfully my parents both lived long enough to be there when I was ready to forgive them. 

You‚Äôre NTA for wanting your uncle to walk you down the isle. That‚Äôs perfectly fine. Your dad doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äúa right‚Äù even if you‚Äôd been living with him your entire youth. I don‚Äôt care if you want a purple penguin giving you away. It‚Äôs your wedding.

What is a bit assholeish, though understandable, is your reaction. It‚Äôs emotional for both of you and it requires a talk with respect to those emotions. You can explain why you want your uncle to give you away. Instead of laughing at someone‚Äôs feelings.

I like to think the best of people until they prove otherwise. I hope your dad regrets what has happened and would just like to be a part of your life and rebuild what has been lost.

"I'm fine with the wave of downvotes this will trigger but NAH.  I honestly hope you never have to find out what it's like to have a seriously ill child, it is horrific beyond description (many marriages don't survive the experience).  I absolutely understand the hurt and anger you felt as a nine year old and wanting more attention from your parents. Have you ever seen a counsellor to help you process that? 

You are justified in wanting your ""father figure"" aka your uncle to walk you down the aisle. It was ok for your dad to ask but he should have been prepared for a no given the family history.  Your brother had no business calling you calling you an AH  he needs to stay in his own lane.

INFO do you have any love for your parents and brother-- are you hoping for some kind of relationship with the three of them moving forward.  If so, sit down with your parents and tell them that you do love them and understand the situation they found themselves in with your brother--but that you were a nine year old child and it hurt you very deeply.  Your aunt and uncle were the ones who raised you and in in your heart became your parents and as such your uncle will be walking you down the aisle. 

Tell them if they accept this you want to have a relationship with them moving forward.  If they can't accept this you'll be disappointed but you and your wife will move forward without them.  

If you don't really feel love for them or the hurt and anger block the love too much, sit down with them and basically have the same convo as above-- express understanding of the dilemma of a gravely ill child BUT that you were a nine year old child who was shunted aside in the process and were deeply hurt and your aunt and uncle became your parents.  I wouldn't ban them from the wedding-- but be clear that they are ""guests"" and that going forward minimal contact might be the best option.

My dad didn't give me anything, he lived far, he didn't try, he was depressed in his own life. I got married, but didn't have a traditional wedding. If I did, I would want my grandpa to walk me (he passed), and the next best thing would be my Uncle, who I lived with longer than my actual father.

My older sister was being an asshole because she had our dad walk her down the aisle üôÑ. I would have even asked my Uncle to do a daughter-father dance with me too, but I omitted that because of Covid.

My mom used to manage some apartments and one day the groundskeeper went in and found a fucking kitten in there. She was about 8/9 weeks and they'd just abandoned her.

"NTA.  And I would NOT pay a cent towards the kitty jail fees.

Story time- I moved to a new neighborhood last year.  First thing I did was get security cams all over the house and yard.  I watched 2 neighborhood cats get splattered on our road- first died instantly, but the second did not and it was AWFUL.  I also got to watch the neighborhood foxes eat an opossum and attack 2 other cats, who survived.

A few months in a 1/2 grown kitten started showing up at my house.  It repeatedly tried to get into my house.  It would climb up my window screens at all hours of the day and night, scaring the heck out of me, and wrecking my window screens.  I asked several neighbors if they knew who the cat belonged to, but nothing.  I grew to like the little cat, but meanwhile it was getting thinner and thinner, covered in fleas and ticks, and I cannot have cats as I am allergic.

So, I found a new home for it.  It was way too adorable and petite to be splattered on the road, eaten by the local wildlife, or left outside in the dead of winter.  It took 3 weeks for the missing cat signs to go up in the neighborhood.  I felt morally ambiguous about giving away someone's cat, but the lack of care and attention they paid to that animal was shameful.  And in that 3 weeks time that the cat was at its new home, she practically had doubled in size.

I see her every now and again, and I am not at all sorry she has a home where she is warm, safe, well-fed, and a completely indoor pet.  She looks gorgeous now, her patchy hair is all filled in, and she is very happy.

I would do it all over again.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

Ex roommate found out and sent a male friend to our house to threaten us in response. The cat disappeared shortly after.

They will find any reason to not cover the repairs and will then send out the cheapest repair person from across the state to look at your issue in 1-2wks. 1-2wks is a long time in July when your house is 94deg and your AC is broke.

Home warranty is just another insurance policy. If you‚Äôre home is older you may be able to get some use out of it. They are in the business to make money.

"I got one included when I purchased my home and renewed it a couple times. It wasn't bad, it just kept getting slightly more expensive every year.

I forget what is cost a decade ago - something like $600-$700 a year ($50 or $60 a month). Claims worked, never had a problem there, but the reality is you need something to go wrong to justify the cost.

You pay your $60/mo and when something breaks you call them. They work out a deal with someone locally who comes out and fixes whatever the problem is. You pay a $100 deductible to the company that comes out, they the insurance company cover the rest.

The problem is major repairs don't come around too often. I made a claim for a dishwasher and furnace and the process was smooth. The problem is both of the repairs would have cost around the same amount as I paid for the home warranty. It was peace of mind for the first couple years of home ownership.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"I must be one of the rare people who actually had a good experience with it. It came included when we purchased the home at the seller's expense, so I didn't buy it on my own out of pocket. But in the first year of owning our house, we had issues with our dishwasher and multiple times with our HVAC that were all covered. I believe there was a small deductible (something like $50) each time, but overall it saved us money.

Something to know is that they will always choose the cheapest possible repair and that will almost never be to to replace what's broken. For example, if you have a 30 yr old furnace that's on the fritz, they'll keep paying to fix it for as long as you have the warranty, but it might have just reached the end of its life and needs to be replaced. That cost would be on you. 

It was nice for that first year of home ownership,  but once we lived in the house for long enough we got an idea for the condition of everything and felt comfortable replacing or fixing stuff on our own. All considered, I did not renew my subscription and would not pay for a new one if it wasn't already included in the closing of my house when I bought it.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

"""Home Warranties"" as they are called, in reality, are no such thing. They aren't warranties at all, but rather they are a form of service contracts, almost like a health insurance polict for your house. Technically they are considered residential service policies.

Just like any other type of insurance policy, if you buy it and don't need it, it seems like a waste of money (even though you did gain/have the non-quantifiable peace of mind that everyone speaks of). 

On the other hand, if you paid $500 for one and it covered your $15,000 HVAC system replacement, it would seem like the best deal ever.

I've been on both sides of the spectrum and I STILL don't know if I think they are worth it!

Thing is, it is impossible to predict the likelihood of ""the IF"" of making a claim, nevermind the ""HOW"" as far as how the process would go if you made a claim. 

Some love them, some hate them. Everyone's experience will be (at least somewhat) unique.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"I'll go  against the grain...

Home warranty was paid for by the seller.

House was old with many issues (was not maintained).

We've gotten many items/repairs paid for or significantly discounted by home warranty. It's actually been a very good experience.

&nbsp;

If you just moved in and you can see the house was poorly maintained it might make sense to get a home warranty. If the house is in good condition, you probably won't get your money back.

Review what the warranty covers and see if any of those items needs repair. Tally the cost to repair and see if the cost of the warranty is less the total repair cost.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Home Warranty companies are a rip off. Think about it: for them to make money, most of their customers have to pay more in premiums than they get in repairs.

If you own property, you need a replacement reserve account. How much you decide to put away is more than my drunk ass is willing to discuss at the moment, but in short: calculate your 20 year maintenance costs, figure out how much you need to put away each month in your favorite interest-bearing account to hit that figure, accounting for the fact that you'll need to make draws before the 20 year mark to account for things that shit the bed before 20 years.",1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1
It is a way to get repairs fairly cheap if you are patient and not picky. We had one for the first five years or so we had our house. Once we had enough money to be able to pay immediately out of pocket for a big repair we stopped buying the warranty.,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
Not worth the hassle.  I paid for one of those on my last houses and it was a complete pain in the butt.  They wouldn't tell me what coverage I had and I had to pay a cover charge for them to just come out.  And if not covered I would foot the whole bill.  My whole fuse box needed to be replaced.  My realtor handled it and went round and round with those idiots.    He ended up paying out of his own pocket and getting a local company to do it.  Can't remember the price but it was definitely over 1k.,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1

"Generally, it is worthwhile for that first year.  Some sellers or realtors purchase it for you as a sign of good faith (depends on area).  Insurance only covers unexpected disasters (oversimplification for the sake of argument).  Home warranty will cover any repairs not identified in the home inspection.  For example, if the water heater, furnace, or stove breaks, they send someone to repair it for a small fee.  However, they cover very specific things only (read the fine print), and just do the cheapest repair possible.  It can be nice that first year when you are usually strapped, but not worth the money long term.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1

"I‚Äôve had AHS for as long as I‚Äôve owned my house - almost 20 years now.

But because the board was going to be $700 to replace, they gave us that towards a credit for a new washer. We took that and bought an $890 Samsung and paid $190.",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1
"The sellers of my home were required to provide one for a year, which seemed reasonable since it‚Äôs an older home. When it came time to renew. Big nope. The one repair I used it for required a $50 inspection fee, the contractor I was forced to use was awful, and the repair cost less than the policy (leaky propane line). I haven‚Äôt needed any repairs since.

Sure, it was kind of nice to have in case something like the water heater went out in the first year‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve lived there 6 years now, so I will just bite the bullet when the time comes. Already saved myself a few grand by *not* having a home warranty policy.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

"Factors with the insurance:

* If the wind event is considered a ""catastrophe"" which many of them are, it should be more forgiving with regard to premiums, renewals and the like.
* Keep in mind many insurance companies give you discounts, including a discount for not having any claims. So even if it's a catastrophe which doesn't affect your premium, your ""no claims"" discount could go away, effectively raising your payment next year.
* Whether they have to ""match"" is based upon state and local law.

"Hey everyone, just gonna sticky a comment real quick about 'why' tipping is a thing in the US, and it can't/shouldn't be boiled down to simply 'it's cultural' - it's also based on labor laws that were established *because* of the culture.

Here's a good resource I suggest anyone interested learning about tipping and wages in the US look at before talking about it. 

**(it's the Department of Labor .gov site, so everything is on-the-books-laws, and instantly updated):**


#https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/minimum-wage/tipped

Now, to explain a few things as simply as I can:

#$2.13.  
This is the bare-bare minimum hourly wage a **tipped** employee ( and not all people who hand you food are on the books as 'tipped' employees ) can earn.  Plain and simple, if someone makes $100 in tips in 1 hour, the employer is legally responsible to pay them, in any US territory, $2.13, by law.

#$5.12.
This is the ""Maximum Tip Credit Against Minimum Wage"", or more simply ""if a worker anywhere in the US makes $0.00 in tips during an hour of pay, the **employer** must pay up to $5.12 to meet the $7.25 federal minimum wage"".  So in *any* state where the **tipped** minimum wage is less than $7.25, you will be paying for a worker's hourly wage, up to $5.12, instead of their employer.

#$7.25
This is the pay rate for every single worker in the US as of July 24, 2009.  Plain and simple, a worker can *never ever ever* be paid less than $7.25/hour if they are on-the-books employee of a business.

But, like I pointed out above, *tipped* employees *can* (oh and trust me, they do) get paid $2.13 by employers, and the rest if either made up for by people tipping, or the owner/employer.

&nbsp;

So remember, the next time you go out to eat, the worker could be getting (by law) anywhere from $7.25/hour to $15.50/hour (probably the former if the state is Republican), and sometimes, *you* pay 2/3 of that $7.25.

And in case it's not obvious, $7.25 was barely a living wage 14 years ago when it was made law.  It *definitely* isn't, anywhere, now.

&nbsp;

Also quick PS:

&nbsp;

If a worker is not specifically labeled as an ""employee"" of a company, a company, lets use Door Dash as an example, can get away with *not* paying the $7.25, *or* $2.13, if they label the worker as a non-employee, and they absolute did, do, and fight laws that say they must, so the company can charge sometimes 100%+ for delivering food, and pay a worker, quite literally 'whatever *they* think is fair'.

Something to keep in mind.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Genuine question: If servers were given the choice between a $15/hr wage or keeping the current tipping system, which would they choose? How about at $20/hr, etc.?

">	Please remember that service staff being underpaid is due to bosses refusing to pay a living wage, and that service staff are not at fault for participating in a tip-based economy. 

This is *such* a weird statement to make imo,  and especially weird to imply mods will ban people who disagree lmao.

Every single friend I have that works in the service industry talks about how much they love tipping - and never seem to want to admit the fact that they get minimum wage if their tips do not meet minimum wage. It‚Äôs *incredibly* disingenuous how often people post their $3 checks and say ‚Äútip your waiter!‚Äù and completely gloss over the fact that they made $1900 in tips during that pay period. 

Tipping culture is so pervasive because business benefit from it and servers benefit from it, so they have no incentive to push back against it. Pretending servers are unwilling participants in the system is asinine; it‚Äôs simply not the case. If servers didn‚Äôt like tipping they could certainly shift the indstury - but tipping in often a more beneficial system for them. When I was a server I consistently had enough money and even during slow periods I had plenty of money (because I made tons during the up periods.)

"At what point is tipping about rewarding a service position that is directly benefiting you versus tipping to supplement low wages? 

If we are tipping to ensure survival for one large group of people(most waiters/waitresses), shouldn‚Äôt we be asking every employee everywhere that we interact with how much income they make so we can make sure they can survive too, and supplement their income? 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to assume how much people make based on the job they do, so isn‚Äôt it up to the customers to ensure that the people they interact with at these business for any reason are making a fair wage? 

How can we sleep at night knowing that we generalize and tip people who bring us food, but not those who say, collect our garbage? 

It would be a travesty to assume that the garbage collector is able to feed their kids, so if we‚Äôre not supplementing their wage, we‚Äôre no better than those that don‚Äôt tip at restaurants. 

If you don‚Äôt ask to see a paystub or W2 for any person who helps you in your role as a customer, and choose to tip based on that number you see, you are a greedy pig. Point blank.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

"Worked as a server for 4 years here‚Äôs my take. 
(Keep in mind in California)

I would clear 100-200 a night in about 3.5-5 hrs of work. And that was at Olive Garden where I check on you about 5-9 times throughout your meal


I never expected 20% as standard tip about 15% was okay bc I am just taking orders and giving out food. There‚Äôs clearly a certain demographic that takes up the industry. Many will bitch abt not receiving 10 bucks on a 50 but literally will come to my table maybe twice. Like I said there‚Äôs a reason your serving and not working fast food it‚Äôs because this job allows you to make so much with so little effort. 

I‚Äôd make 2.8k after tips and check working on avg 3-4 days a week and maybe picking up a double here and there. I was well overpaid for what I did lol compared to what I actually worked.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Yeah well, not everyone on the internet lives in the USA. Where I live, servers make the minimum wage of $15.65 per hour, which is going up to $16.75 soon, and they STILL expect tips.

They are claiming they need an increased percentage because of inflation. Yeah, well, the meal went up by 30% over pre-COVID levels, so if you increase the percentage as well, now they are looking at an 80%-100% raise on the tips, so stuff that, go to math school and learn how percentages work.",1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1
"A person ordering from door dash may have to do so not for luxury reasons, but because they just had surgery and have no one to bring them food.

It's not their fault your employer refuses to pay you.",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
"So let's lay these arguments out straight:

If I DO tip, I...

1. Perpetuate a system that is - by and large - intentionally oppressive (facts based on mountains of research)
2. Put inappropriate pressure on the customer to figure out what to tip
3. Tip in a way that may or may not affect the wages of the worker I'm interacting with, since some workers are tip-based... and some are not... some supplement their base salary... and some do not... and none of them are required to wear some colored armbands that might possible distinguish their particular pay system for me!

If I DON'T tip...

1. I'm hurting the worker... maybe (again, no armband)
2. Not hurting the business, unless they lose their tipped staff, too
3. BUT, no longer have to worry as a customer about how much is or is not right

If I perpetuate the system nothing will change, and those not privy to good-tipping environments will continue to be oppressed, but have occasional good days, too.

If I fight the system people will be hurt in the short-run, but there's an off-chance the system might change.

If I stop going to tip-oriented businesses I can ""stick it to the owner"" by not purchasing from them... although the tipped worker will now see a general decline in customers/tips anyway, and potentially loses their job when the business goes under, so there's that.

If I go to fast-food/non-tipping places I can avoid the whole debacle, but then I'm secretly given the mega-corporate overlords exactly what they wanted.

About right so far?

\*\*\*\*\*

There's pros and cons, but what I'm really hearing is that people want to change the system WITHOUT anyone being hurt.

Well, sorry, but there's no such thing as a bloodless revolution.

As for people on tips crying that they need more, I have to firmly come down on the side of boo hoo.  There are lots of people doing really important things that require a college degree, students loans, years of experience, ongoing professional development, etc. and still make less than $50,000.  An otherwise nominally skilled tip-based job should not be decrying the system if they are actually beating it hands down.

THE REAL PROBLEM: it's called **wage compression**.  Look it up.

Tips are just a distraction... a shiny object to keep the masses arguing over who gets better scraps.  It is the result of owners and stockholders who are not just satisfied with earning a 5% profit, but this year they want to earn a 7% profit ON TOP OF 10% growth in revenue, too.  

While controlling and holding expenses as flat as possible (e.g., wages).

This is what is known as **greed**.  If I can screw you for 5%, then odds are better than even I can screw you for 10.  Let me be clear I'm part of what is known as the ""investor class"", where I don't rely on wages as much anymore to provide income, and even I understand that this trend is unsustainable.

It isn't just that profits/dividends are king, it's that we have now made \*growth\* king, and that's what 's killing the system, because compounding growth is totally unsustainable.  It used to be that a business that had growth that just kept up with inflation was fine.  Today that is entirely unacceptable if your buying stocks.

I could continue, but that's good enough for now.  Consider accordingly.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"If you want to eradicate the tipping system, then there is only one way to do it -- get enough people to quit tipping. Think about this as an exercise in game theory. There are 4 parties involved in the tipping system -- businesses, workers, customers, and governments. Businesses want to pay workers the least amount possible and the government decides that amount. Workers want to be paid the highest amount possible and the customers decide that amount. It is important to understand that, first and foremost, it's the customers who are being exploited by this system, and the other 3 parties have no incentive to change it because they all benefit from it in some way. Specifically, it's only the customers that tip generously who are being exploited -- the ones who don't get to enjoy lower food prices on the backs of those who do leave tips. This highlights how the system is inherently unfair and unjust as it penalizes good actors and rewards bad actors and why it must be eradicated. Since the people benefitting from it have no incentive to change, any positive disruption has to be driven by the customers. Moreover, this is a zero-sum game, it is structurally impossible for one party to gain something without another party losing something. 

Now the customer has three options -- patronize restaurants and tip generously, patronize restaurants and do not tip generously, or avoid restaurants altogether. The first option is status quo, and will result in no change. Let's take the remaining two options and extrapolate them at scale -- i.e. assume a large enough block of customers behaves similarly and sustains that behavior for long enough to introduce a disruption to the status quo.

One suggestion that gets trotted around a lot is that if you don't like tipping, don't go to restaurants. This is not a good option, and results in an overall net negative value, as nobody benefits from it in the larger scale. If customers stop patronizing restaurants, it hurts the restaurant, workers, the government and customers themselves. Restaurants lose business and workers are let go as a result, government loses tax revenue from both and customers don't get to enjoy eating out. There is no straightforward way in which this leads to businesses paying workers more because they will not have the demand to justify the increased payroll expenses.

The only other option is for customers to patronize restaurants without tipping generously. This seems harsh, but it is the only viable option that can result in an eradication of tipping while providing living wages for workers, with the potential of raising the minimum wage as well. It plays out in multiple stages. At first, it is only the workers and government who are at a loss by missing out on tips and income taxes respectively. This is not sustainable and over time workers will leave their restaurant jobs because they simply cannot afford to work there anymore. Businesses will lose revenue because they still have demand they need to meet, but no supply of workers to meet it. This will be a tipping point (no pun intended), wherein businesses will either need to raise wages on their own accord to attract/retain workers to meet the demand and continue to survive, and/or government will need to raise the minimum wage in order to maintain their revenue. Logically, this is the only option that works. Yes, it hurts workers in the beginning, but you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, charging a fair price for it, and paying your workers a living wage to serve it to your customers.

Am I suggesting that you stop tipping? No, I'm not - nothing will change if you as an individual quit tipping -- it will only hurt individual workers, without the benefit of large-scale societal/cultural change. In order for the plan outlined above to successfully bring about a sea change, it would require a coordinated effort on the part of a very large number of people, which does not exist presently. It will require organization of a movement to enlist millions of people to commit to changing their behavior over a substantial period of time. Until that is in play, then my advice would be to continue tipping generously or avoid businesses that don't pay their employees enough to live off.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"...and all the comments below are why some of us outside the US are scratching our heads saying 'you make it so complicated!' When I used to travel for business, the biggest headache was figuring out how much to tip and where/to whom.

Here in the UK, there's always been an expectation to tip 10% for reasonable service, for and directly to food service workers, hair dressers, hotel staff/porter/car valet, and in recent years food delivery drivers.  So if I queue in a line to buy something, I wouldn't expect to tip usually; if someone brings me something/does something for me (bring food/shampoo my hair), I expect to tip. Some areas have a habit of tipping bar staff too but it's *not* across the board. And it could be more or less than 10% if it's exceptionally crap or brilliant service.

Given his tendencies towards manipulation and scheming, Luthor may use the food supply disruption to stir up social unrest and political instability, thereby creating opportunities for himself to seize power.

"Yes, it's true but most Korean citizens have been opposing steadily the government's bad decision to join the war. Because they urge that war is a problem for Europeans, which means Europeans should solve this complicated situation without Asia's support. 

Because Asia has had the strongest super villain China, the related military power should be used to stop China's rampage in Asia instead of supporting Ukraine, according to their theories. Basically, they thought NATO's power is so huge, and members of the military group can solve the war regardless of Korea's military reinforcements. 

According to Koreans' opinions, Europeans are superior-excellent people who don't need inferior Asia's backup, so those Korean people don't like the USA & NATO's military requests. What's more, the Russian foreign minister warned South Korea through this sentence ""Shouldn't join this war without any compensation from the US & NATO"". 

Moreover, Korean President Yun's approval rating is under 30%, so he should be careful to decide on the matter if he doesn't want to be resigned by raging Korean voters.

My husband was immediately concerned with having a ‚Äúproper‚Äù fence installed, not the old metal stakes & cattle wire that we‚Äôd used while renting, being as we‚Äôd bought this new house and wanted ‚Äúto do things proper.‚Äù  We looked at prices (small panic attacks ensued) and then‚Ä¶ up went the exact same cattle wire and metal poles that we had used before and they work just fine.  The geriatric dog is still kicking but probably not for much longer and then we can take the fence down‚Äî it‚Äôll be a HELL of a lot easier to mow.   He (husband) ALSO worked from home for the first 2 years (COVID) and absolutely HATED the drop ceiling/fluorescent lights in the finished basement.  Was hell bent on having the drop ceiling removed, the walls/ceiling finished off and proper lighting installed.  Then he went back to the office 3 days a week and realized ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine just the way it is, for now.‚Äù    We had initially agreed that the ceiling was going to be our #1 renovation ‚Äúon the list‚Äù up until that point.  

Me, on the other hand‚Ä¶ I want a clawfoot bathtub installed in the master bathroom (that had originally been a small bathroom plus a small bedroom but was converted into one large master bath before we bought it).  An entire bedroom-sized bathroom with only a walk-in shower.  NO BATHTUB‚Äî just dead, unusable space.  That was #2 on ‚Äúour list.‚Äù   I HAVE the bathtub (just not the feet, don‚Äôt ask) and there had already been a bathtub in the room before they converted it, so the fixtures are under the floor, just capped off.  This could  happen without hurting the wallet too much.  That was #2 on ‚Äúthe list.‚Äù  

BUUUUUT.  The washer/dryer are directly next to the kitchen‚Äî which was not originally, but is NOW an open floor plan‚Äî  on the top floor along with the once [separate] dining and living rooms (FIE!! Fie! Open floor plans are the worst, GIVE ME DOORS!)   The  sheer volume levels of the washer and/or dryer, and God forbid- the dishwasher too-  all running at the same time is absolutely miserable.  And we have a 2 car garage on the other side of the kitchen wall that we pretty much only use for storage.  

And NOW!?!?  #1 on the ‚ÄúNEW LIST‚Äù is converting 1 of the garage bays into livable square footage as a glorified deep freezer/laundry/mud room that would ALSO allow us to utilize space/options for updating our KITCHEN.  And we dearly love to cook.  

This post was *intentionally* long winded, because it took us 3 years of living in a perfectly ‚Äúok‚Äù new home to realize what we actually want to change that will benefit both our needs AND comfort.  And I‚Äôm grateful that we waited to figure out what was most important to us because we plan on being here for a long time.  

Still want that clawfoot bathtub though.   Husband is traveling out of country in a couple of months and I wonder if I get away with asking for forgiveness instead of approval‚Ä¶",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

- If the air conditioning label says it‚Äôs R-22 know that refrigerant has been discontinued and the cost to fix those systems literally gets more expensive every day.
- If the AC condenser (outside unit) isn‚Äôt level it‚Äôs hard on the compressor and when that goes out it‚Äôs a very expensive fix.
- Turn on the shower for a while and see if it leaks out the shower pan before buying.
- Test to see if you have a steady supply of hot water and make sure your plumbing is also maintaining pressure.
- Test every single fixture and appliance in the house. Plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling, lighting, kitchen, etc. This is tedious but important. Get a receptacle/ outlet tester for like $10 and check every outlet. Also hit the test button and reset on your GFCI receptacles. The code is always updating more locations for them but you at least want a protected circuit in both your kitchen and bath.
- Check for trees overhanging the roof or too close to the siding. If branches overhang you‚Äôll likely get moss one day which needs to be cleaned or it‚Äôll damage the roof. Branches too close to siding and windows can damage them during a storm. Trim appropriately. Also cut back shrubs away from your AC condenser while you‚Äôre at it so it can properly vent heat.",1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1

Follow the inspector every second they are there. My husband was looking at something when ours ‚Äúwent into the attic‚Äù. Only thing is he never went in the attic.

Make sure the inspector is decent. The guy who inspected our house was very vague about how bad things were. And we didn‚Äôt understand anything we read in the report.

"Buy less than what you can ‚Äúafford‚Äù. You can step up later as your equity and income grow. 

1. The amount of things that you need money freed up for every month for the first couple years while you upgrade and make a home your own can be far more than you think. Needing to replace your water heater or deciding to change all the knobs and handles in your home should NOT be financially devastating even if improvements may need to be incremental.

2. Buying less than what you can afford makes you less vulnerable to economic fluctuations either in income or the economy. Money in money out is stressful. People make 6 figures year but are paycheck to paycheck it‚Äôs dumb but pretty common. Avoid it and live below your means.
Storytime: my partner and I are high earners which is a blessing. We were approved for 1.2mil. We priced out the mortgage, tax and insurance and decided it was more than we wanted to fork over a month even for our ideal home. Instead we decided on a cute 1800sf townhome for 650k in one of our ideal neighborhoods. Seemed like a reasonable compromise of we weren‚Äôt gonna get a Single Family home on the first go. I kid you not nearly 3 months to the day after we closed and moved in we lost just over a third of our household income. Why?‚Ä¶because economyü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Anyways it sucked but you know what we weren‚Äôt worried about? Paying our mortgage!! We budget to live on about 60% give or take of our income. I know not everyone is in a position to do that but if you‚Äôre in a position to purchase a home them there should be flexibility in how you manage your funds. Buy a smaller home and work you way up. Keep the buffer. We‚Äôve been together 10 years and have always lived below our means because while we like nice stuff we like comfort more and not stressing about money if we don‚Äôt have to. Every dollar that comes into your home shouldn‚Äôt be required to maintain your lifestyle.

3. Do all the inspections. Just spend the money. If you can‚Äôt afford the 200 or 300 for additional inspections ie termite, hvac etc. then your likely not quite ready to buy. It‚Äôs a gamble. If you can‚Äôt afford to inspect it then you can‚Äôt afford to replace or repair it.

Not that you need to prime masonry, but I'm willing to bet this gets a lot of sunlight at some specific time during the day.  Heat and humidity changing throughout the day can cause chipping like this over time.

He didn‚Äôt mind students using ChatGPT to write their papers. His approach to this was for the professors needing to change how things are handled.

Overall the idea is to challenge the critical thinking of what made them write or phrase the paper as they did. And if they show a clear understanding of what is in their own paper and how they reason the different conclusions and examples used then it shows they know the topic.

I (38f) have known ‚ÄòAlly‚Äô (40f) for 15 years. We first met at work when were single and the youngest people there. We became good friends and socialised together and still do. 

Ally then met her partner ‚ÄòMatt‚Äô who she is still with years later. 

He does not share her interests. He is an avid football supporter (UK) and very anti the rival football team.  Even when he doesn‚Äôt go to watch matches live, he watches at the pub with male friends.  He plays sport with his friends. She‚Äôs a football widow. She likes going to the theatre and to dinner. He‚Äôll  go to dinner with her but doesn‚Äôt much enjoy the theatre unless it‚Äôs a serious play (she likes musicals) and she ends up going with female friends. She says she doesn‚Äôt mind, they aren‚Äôt joined at the hip and she has plenty of friends and relatives who enjoy going to the theatre with her and that she doesn‚Äôt want to go to football. I wonder‚Ä¶

I am known for being brutally honest. When she introduced me to Matt, she asked my opinion and I gave it. I didn‚Äôt really see them together. I didn‚Äôt like that he drinks and swears. He has a professional job but isn‚Äôt very ‚Äòrefined‚Äô unlike her and I found him a bit difficult to connect to. 

At the time she was hurt but got over it and generally just engineered it so I never really saw him. He was always ‚Äòbusy‚Äô when I organised a party etc. They now have 2 young boys and he looks after them when she comes out with her friends. 

TBH more recently my opinion of him has improved. He seems to be a really good daddy to the boys and they clearly adore him. They are also football mad!

It took me longer to meet my SO ‚ÄòEdward‚Äô but I now have and we have just got engaged. Ally and Matt both attended our engagement party. Edward actually also likes football and ended up getting on really well with Matt. 

Later I asked Ally if she‚Äôd be up for doing something as couples, as Edward and Matt got on well. She was non-committal. A few weeks later I tried to arrange something and she accepted for herself but ‚ÄúMatt was busy‚Äù. I explained I wanted to do something with the 4 of us when he was free. She kept stalling. I pushed it (maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have) and she said it wasn‚Äôt a good idea because he and I didn‚Äôt get on. I said it was ok, I‚Äôd changed my opinion more recently and Edward liked him. She looked surprised and then awkwardly let me know it was because he didn‚Äôt really like me! She ‚Äúthought I knew‚Äù! 

I didn‚Äôt and I was upset - this was news. I asked her why. She was embarrassed but said he found me judgmental and ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. I don‚Äôt even know what that means.  A few other examples as well! 

I was hurt and told her I had assumed she kept us apart because I didn‚Äôt like him not the reverse.  She said that we didn‚Äôt get on so what difference did it make. I‚Äôm beyond hurt and did react badly and told her some home truths about him. I regret this now and tried to apologise but she won‚Äôt return my calls.

Do you want to salvage this friendship & make it better??

Because wallowing in your ‚Äúfeeling hurt‚Äù over his rejection of you is NOT going to strengthen your Friendship üíú

To create a better Friendship: Write him a letter addressed to both your friend & him.

Tell him you are sorry for misjudging him and that you were foolish to base your judgment on him based on him liking sports. 

Do not make excuses for it. 

Do not blame it on something else.

Just apologize for it.

Tell him that you were wrong.

Tell him that you can see what a wonderful Father he is to his children and an amazing role model for them and that you are so thankful that your friend met him and that they have a Beautiful Life together.

Ask his forgiveness and ask if he would be willing to give you another chance. That you would love for the 4 of you to get together and enjoy a night out.

Offer to pay for their Sitter.

Expect nothing from him.

Do not get angry if he chooses to say no.

"YTA - with a slight side step. Are you neurodivergent? (Autistic/ADHD?) 

Because it sounds like you might be. The clues of brutally honest/ judgemental and being considered 'too much' are labels very much given to women who are neurodivergent. I get it a lot. I'm ADHD and most likely Autistic as well. I've been told I'm 'too much', though I'm too much of a people pleaser to be brutally honest with anyone. But I have found myself incredibly judgemental and have worked on not doing that and expressing it where it is inappropriate to do so. 

That aside - you just burned this friendship and it is absolutely your fault. 

You didn't filter yourself when you first met him and most likely was obvious of your dislike to this guy's face. He decided he didn't like this friend of his girlfriend but wasn't enough for either of them to give up the relationship so they married.

 Their agreement was that he didn't have to interact with you - but since you didn't care for him either it was nearly a non issue. Now you don't mind him so much but he still has this boundary. 

Now was it surprising that he doesn't like you? Maybe - you weren't paying attention to him on his interactions with you - just more how he operated as a person. So yes I can see how it was a shock. But instead of realizing yeah that makes sense - I hated him for a while & made it clear to everyone - you went nuclear. 

Arguing about that you 'didnt know' and that this information now offended you and THEN ADDED MORE JUDGEMENT on him just burned any reason for your friend to keep your friendship. 

Her husband should be her #1 in all things. You may have known her longer & had a great bond, but her husband comes FIRST. especially now they have kids and a life. She will not give that up for you. You just proved that you're incompatible with her life. And she doesn't have to forgive you. 

So I hope this leads you to some self reflection and you can put this friendship as a nice memory of your past.

You need to make a profound change in how you treat people. Stop judging. You thought you saw the flint in his eye while he saw a big redwood in yours.

The way Matt saw you is the way lots of people see judgmental people. They aren't judging you, so why judge them? Nobody, including yourself-likes being looked down on. They instantly become defensive, whether visible or invisible. Matt was invisible.

The trick is you can still be nice to people who might not fancy. You don't have to fancy a person before you appreciate them. There's lots of good in people, who many consider rotten. A nice gift can melt their hearts. Many are mean because of all the hurt they've faced.

He thinks you're judgmental - you are. You formed judgements of him (without really spending time getting to know him), disliked him for them and were happy to avoid him.

'Too much'? That would be insisting your opinion is the valid one, to the point where your friend just chose to phase her partner out of your life, rather than have to deal with you and your opinions about him. 

You didn't even realise it! Just assumed she was arranging things for *your* benefit! Cos who could be more important, right?

What 'home truths' could you, in your utter arrogance, really feel you're privy to, above and beyond his partner? I suspect you just slung whatever insults came to mind.

I also don't like people who don't like me. Particularly when I'm not engaged in toxic behaviour that gives them a reason to dislike me. 

I'm sorry this lesson is so costly to learn. I would give it a little time and approach your friend with a little vulnerability and an admission that you've been: 

- Judgmental of Matt for years with no good reason (her being happy should have been good enough) 
- Judgmental in general of people who don't align closely with your perspective and that this has taught you to be more open and less closed off to superficial differences
- Unfairly hurt and way out of line for finding Matt's dislike so offensive 
- Acted like a complete brat when you should have been more understanding 
- Understand that Matt is allowed to continue to have his boundaries but that you would love to apologize to both of them.
-Understand that if he or both of them don't want to hear it that you'll give them space and that you'll check back in a couple weeks from now

Put something to that effect in an email or letter.

"YTA, but not because of the assumption.

&nbsp;

Whilst it *does* slightly smack of arrogance that you assumed that now that you'd changed your mind about him he was going to be up for doing coupley things together when you (presumably, being known for your brutal honesty and all) had made it clear you didn't think much of him - that's not what makes you the arsehole.

&nbsp;

What *does* make you the arsehole is firstly the double standard - your friend had asked you your opinion of him and you shared it, all above board so far. You're entitled to your opinion, and if she asks you for it and you share, then the old adage about ""If you've nothing nice to say"" can go out of the window, because your friend has asked for your thoughts and you've been honest. All fair game.

&nbsp;

On the flip side to that, when she was non-committal about going out as a couple and you pushed it (which yes, you shouldn't have) and then when she told you he didn't like you, you pushed further still and wanted to know why. He's just as entitled to his opinion, and if you ask the question then you'll get an answer (again, hopefully an honest one as you are friends) - which given the question was ""Why doesn't he like me?"" you probably weren't ever going to like. Up until this point she had protected you from this, because there was no need to let you know. But you made an issue out of it, and found out. Getting butthurt about this, as though it's fine for *you* to have a negative opinion of him, but not vice versa is partly why YTA.

&nbsp;

However, the much larger part of why YTA is your reaction and retaliation. In response to finding out he didn't like you, you 'reacted badly' and told her some (completely unsolicited in this instance) 'home truths' about him.

&nbsp;

Well, in the vein of being brutally honest, here's what you need to face up to:

&nbsp;

You're nearly 40 years old. You're not a child. And yet, by behaving in this way, you're demonstrating the emotional maturity of one. ""He hurt me, so I hurt him back"" is how you'd expect their young boys to act, not a grown adult. You (figuratively) backed your friend into a corner and even though you could tell she was feeling awkward and embarrassed about the situation, you continued to push - and when you got an answer you didn't like you lashed out at him (and by extension her, as they are now an established unit) in an unwarranted attack on his character.

&nbsp;

Why you felt the need to do this should be a reflection point for you. Were the examples given too close to the bone? Or was it because you looked down upon him and couldn't handle the thought that a 'lesser' person might not think highly of you and wouldn't leap at the chance of having your company nowthat you'd changed your mind about him? Maybe it was something completely different, only you can know...but you *do* need to reflect upon this and try and understand what that reaction was about, because from this it sounds like his ""too much"" assessment is pretty on the money",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Most people put some effort in being gentle and caring about other people feelings.

Considering yourself ""brutally honest"" is a way of expressing that you don't care and don't want to do the same effort other people do to be nice to you.

That alone could be considered being an AH.

You probably give a hard time to a person that cares for you talking thrash about a new partner you did not know enough.  Doble points.

Okay, so you're one of those self confessed ""brutally honest"" people. What a fun character trait to have, lol.

Yes, you're right, she asked, you answered based off I'm guessing the first few times hanging out and seeing him? You didn't like his drinking and swearing rah rah..all that, okay fair enough.

But you also obviously made an impression on him, and that was judgey and too much, so how come someone who is brutally honest with people can't handle when they have been honest with them? Your friends husband was just being honest based off his limited interactions with you, so you obviously came of super judgemental if he noticed enough to tell his Wife that's what he thought of you?

Like you said at the time your friend was 'hurt' when you were maybe a little too honest with her but she got over it, so maybe you will get over this too? 

Did she act petty and go off at you when you were honest with her about Matt all those years ago?

""I‚Äôm beyond hurt and did react badly and told her some home truths about him""

So you gave her more home truths about him even though you said you had started liking him over the years, what were these home truths? As you said he seemed like a great daddy to his boys.

"You were very judgemental about your friend‚Äôs partner when you met him. Even though you gave your opinion to your friend when he wasn‚Äôt there, there is no doubt he picked up on the judgemental vibe you were putting out.

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case here.

Matt dislikes you for being judgemental, and he has reason to. He saw you for who you are, while you judged him based on mannerisms that don't align with yours. Swearing, drinking (at least in moderation) and liking football don't make him a bad person.

So I apologized to them for my past actions, was genuinely kind, and did everything to gain their trust. 

So if there is any advice I might give, and you can either use or reject, is to say that you were young, protective, and genuinely sorry. You want to genuinely be friends, and that you are willing to be vulnerable if they are willing to do the same. If they aren't, just work on the relationship that you already have with your friend and eventually, if you are lucky, they may open up if you remain open and willing to be kind.

Their whole relationship you've been acting judgmental towards him and disliking/avoiding him, and he picked up on it and for good reason now is not super keen on hanging out with YOU in turn, and now you're mad and saying ""he's mean"" - can't take a dose of your own medicine, eh?

Keep in mind we're only seeing your side of the story - and it still makes YTA.  And the thing is you started disliking him over not sharing interests, and his dislike of you only came about when you were a jerk to him/about him.  I mean, if your friend was crying to you that she'd been begging him to go to the theatre and he wouldn't do anything she wanted ever your dislike of him would have been one thing, but that's not what you described, the relationship sounds more like two people who don't have to share all their hobbies but still dig each other.  So your dislike of him was more of a jerk thing than his was of you (his of you was more of a reaction to your superior attitude about him).

And your issue with your friend - you were all fine and dandy to be separated from him when you thought ""It's because I don't like him"", and thought that was normal/natural, but the thought of someone applying that very same logic to YOU is suddenly ""how dare they!""  You honestly do sound judgmental and ""too much"", as from this post it looks like you think you deserve better treatment than others and for people to vy to be ""worthy"" of you, when you don't treat them that way.  I mean, just reread your post, can you not see this??

PS -  it's been my experience that everyone I've ever met who described themself as ""brutally honest"" uses it as an excuse to say mean things to others, but yet can't take that same ""brutal honesty"" towards themselves.  Being honest is a good quality, but work on ""gentle honesty"", have some consideration for your friends' and others' feelings, develop empathy for others, etc.  Like if someone was in a truly toxic or unhealthy relationship (which it does not sound like this is), then having an honest friend would be invaluable, but there's no reason to be brutal about it, gentle and loving honesty goes a lot further when warranted.  And if it's something stupid/minor (like this sounds like it wasn't someone YOU would date, but that he's a nice guy and your friend wanted to date him), then maybe learn to keep unnecessary negative opinions to yourself.  I guarantee, from your description of yourself, that people are holding their tongues on a lot of what they could say about you.

There is no such thing as a true/close friendship with a brutally honest person.
These are typically only close acquaintances that are in part codependent.

Most associations with brutally honest types are rather filtered affairs and mostly shallow.
It is not at all uncommon for people to modify their behaviour specifically around those people.
This I know as I have been that person that people modified their behaviour around.
It takes time and real work to correct.
It's a huge character failing and it should be corrected for the sake of all involved.

I'd be VERY intrigued to see OP's acquaintance in a situation both with and without OP present.
I'd wager that it would be an exceedingly different experience.

Quite simply if you actually care about your friends and family you NEED care about how you make them feel or you are just ""That Person"".

You didn't give her any truths about her partner, you gave her your unsolicited opinion. Very different. These truths you like to be brutally honest about are just that, opinions. That you give them when you're not asked to, or in a very rough way, makes you judgemental.
I'm autistic with zero social intuition. I can come out as rude, because I don't understand how people will interpret what I'm saying or I didn't understand the context of the question and answered it literally.

The problem: 
You felt good about passing judgement and felt good about the situation when you thought your friend was protecting you from Matt. But now you‚Äôre hypocritically upset to learn she was protecting Matt from you.

Solution:

Acknowledge your hypocrisy and character flaws and ask for forgiveness and causal opportunities to get to know Matt better.

You don‚Äôt have to say this to Matt, doing so would be awkward for him and put him on the spot. 

You could tell her, ‚Äú okay I‚Äôm done being hypocritical and butt hurt about this. I care about you and your family, Matt is your family and I see how good he‚Äôs been for you. I was young and immature when I made assumptions about him early on in your relationship. I have been judgy and overall a lot, I get it. I want to become better and if you and matt see any good opportunities I would be greateful if matt could give me a chance. And like, if I‚Äôm ever im ever a lot, just tell me, I won‚Äôt be defensive- I want to unlearn that, I know it‚Äôs a lot to ask.‚Äù

And then leave the ball in their court, don‚Äôt be pushy or weird or try too hard to not be you. I recommend having short casual bursts. Like an activity ie bowling.

If you're going to judge people harshly be prepared to be judged in return. If you're going to be 'brutally honest' about people's faults be prepared for them to be the same about yours. 

I'm sure others here will say it but I have never once met someone who called themselves 'brutally honest' who wasn't using it to excuse the fact they are rude and a bit of an asshole. If you say something mean and rude about someone, you are still mean and rude even if it's true. Sometimes you can just shut your mouth. 

'Brutally honest' means you point out flaws and bad things in people yes? That's the same thing as being judgemental. He called you something that you, by your own admission, are. And yet hearing it hurt your feelings. Could it be that you don't like being given the same brutal honesty you pride yourself on? Yeah, of course you're the asshole. You give it but you can't take it. Grow a pair or learn some manners. 

Apologise to your friend for lashing out, be 'brutally honest' about your own failings and admit that it hurt to hear you had been judged negatively but what you said was unfair. Accept her partner doesn't like you. It is far, far too late to change that.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"YTA. I‚Äôm not sure if OP is aware that everything you share with someone usually makes its way to their partner. It might not be a universal truth, but it‚Äôs probably best to operate under the assumption that it is.

Any and all shit talking you do to someone about their partner will probably reach their ears. When my fianc√©‚Äôs sister was helping us move, when I was out of the room she said some nasty things about me. My partner told me later, and we both were like, ‚Äúwhy did she think you would side with her over your chosen partner you live with?‚Äù

If you ask me, a friend asking for your thoughts on their new partners is not the time to be brutally honest. Unless I‚Äôm genuinely worried my friend is being manipulated or abused, I would just give a flat positive response, whether or not I truly liked them. It‚Äôs hard to gauge if this person is going to be in their life for one month or for the rest of the friendship, and I want to leave a door open for a good relationship with them depending on how things go.

But that‚Äôs just me. She asked, you were brutally honest. Ok. Once it becomes clear this partner isn‚Äôt going anywhere, maybe it‚Äôs time to revive that convo, clarify your thoughts a bit and possibly apologize.

Some things in life are better left unsaid.

Only way forward here is for you to talk to him one on one and ask him what's up, if he's avoiding you because of the past you should apologise for being so brutally honest and let him know that going forward, you'd like to work on your friendship. Let him know the positive traits you see in him and ask him to give you all a chance at moving forward.

What.

Do you not believe her? Do you not believe couples can be independent and have their own hobbies and be their own people? 

> Edward actually also likes football

Oh. You do. You do believe that. 

> I am known for being brutally honest. 

> he found me judgmental and ""too much""

This surprises you? 

You're not an AH per se for not realizing it, but your self awareness level is zero. 

You basically just described a person with neutral attributes as well as positive ones, with no real bad ones. Liking football and drinking and swearing are not negative things? Being 'unrefined'--he's a person. Christ. From your own description, he's a good dad and has a good job, and he's comfortable enough in his relationship to not feign interest in her hobbies, but rather they are both independent. That's not a bad thing. 

> did react badly and told her some home (hard?) truths about him. 

Ohohoho you're going to have to expand on that. You tried to slip it in without being specific. What action is actually on trial here? Because it's not as you phrased it, that you just ""didn't realize it."" You can't be an AH for being unaware of something that someone has intentionally kept from you. But you CAN be an AH for how you react when they tell you. How's that brutal honesty thing working out? 

You're a hypocrite in more ways than one.

As soon as I saw ‚Äúbrutally honest‚Äù I knew you were the issue and the rest of your post backed that up. If you had been more open minded you could have met the guy who became the good father.

Also, calling yourself brutally honest is bullshit. You‚Äôre just rude and judgmental. Brutal honesty is just a way to justify being rude without accepting any responsibility for your words.

For a person who is known for being 'brutally honest,' you sure do have a hard time hearing even non-brutal honesty about yourself. Why should you feel hurt that he correctly assessed you as being judgmental? You are.

Even if you don't think you are, that's his honest opinion of you. He and Ally were kind of enough to spare you any 'brutal honesty for maybe a decade. She only shared his honest opinion of you because you didn't take a polite no for an answer.

You want to be brutally honest with people but can't handle it when they are brutally honest with you. That hurt you are feeling right now is something you inflict on people regularly and expect them to say ""hey that's just how she is"".

"YTA, but at least it's dawning on you...slowly...so you may NBTA again, at some point in the (probably far distant) future.

Nobody likes everything about anybody. The key to NBTA is not to be the one stepping farther over the norms of polite behavior than most. Does that sound like you? Because it sure doesn't sound like you to me.

A less A person, to me, would have accepted that you and Matt aren't each others cup of tea and worked out some sensible arrangement. TBF, it sounds like you did that. Everyone can use time away from the SO, so simply avoiding going out together was perfectly sensible.

The problem is your rather bizarre (IMO) reaction to hearing the cause of the separate socializing. What difference does the cause make, first of all? Why on earth should you expect your pal to care more about you than the love of her life? How can you be hurt that this is the case? Just to remind you, you're not the one having sex and procreating with her (as far as I know--if you are, well, maybe you're NTA). Why do you think it's okay to speak your brutal truths about the love of your best friend's life, when that can't possibly be what she hopes her friends do?

Non-A people would have gently encouraged the separate socializing; they would have been tactful about their friend's SO, so as not to put her in an awkward spot; and they would have been not just polite, but kind and good-hearted with him despite not sharing his tastes and appreciating his style...within limits. If the topic turned to football for more than a few minutes, it would have been perfectly reasonable to explain that you're not a fan/change the subject/go for a drink and not come back, at least not when your pal and her SO look to still be talking about football. I have watched non-A's in the shoes of you and Matt collaborate to steer conversation away from the shoals of both football and musical theater for the benefit of his spouse and your friend. Above all to NBTA, you need to gracefully accept the person your pal is living and procreating with is very likely (if not necessarily) her number one adult by a a long shot, and be a good distant #2 (or 3,4 or whatever) who understands and accepts with good grace who #1 is.",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

He told the class once that how, if you meet a person, without interacting, and you end up not liking that person, chances are that person does not like you either. It was a great comfort to me, knowing that I could let people slip if I did not like them, without being impolite or so, because the feeling was likely mutual.

"Yeah so‚Ä¶. If you criticise a good friends SO, (not as in listening and agreeing with them if they are complaining/venting, but like, fully saying that their SO is not good enough / not right for them / you don‚Äôt like them etc), well, that‚Äôs not something you‚Äôre really ever going to be able to walk back. 

Your friend is always going to remember that judgement, and the fact that you felt it strongly enough to voice it. The fact that you felt it strongly enough that it overrode your belief in their own good judgement to make decisions (and choose a partner) for themselves. You weren‚Äôt just saying that you didn‚Äôt like her partner, you were saying that you didn‚Äôt believe in her judgement in pursuing the relationship. 

So, from that moment on she has two choices. 
1) Believe in your judgement, likely loose a bit of self confidence in her own, ditch him, and hope to find someone that pleases you more
2) Believe in her own judgement despite the significance of you making such a call, ignore you, and protect her partner and herself from future judgement (likely resulting in a slight separation of friendship intimacy with you - you may or may not have noticed this, depending on how sensitive she is, or how insensitive you are).

It appears your friend went for option 2, she trusted her own judgement more than yours. And, it looks like, by your own admission, you were wrong after all. Her judgement was, in fact, much better than yours. 

Now, years later, you want to walk it back? That ship has sailed. You just didn‚Äôt notice. 

The things you say and do have ramifications. The judgements you seemingly somewhat flippantly made years ago have had, and will always have, an impact on your relationship with your friends partner, and by extension your relationship with your friend. 

In future, if a friend asks you for an opinion on their partner, tread more carefully. It‚Äôs not a time to be brutally honest, unless you are 100% sure you are right and that your rightness is something worthy of risking your future relationship for. It‚Äôs a time to help your friend figure out what THEY think, not what YOU think. That is what she was asking you for all those years ago. She was asking you to help her figure out how she felt about him. 

I feel like YTA is harsh, because you weren‚Äôt trying to hurt her, you just weren‚Äôt really listening to her or thinking about her. I don‚Äôt think you realised the ramifications of what you were doing. But, you can‚Äôt expect things not to be the way they are now.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

You said you don't know what judgemental and too much means....after you spent paragraphs judging him for his interests and for swearing. 

Knowing the UK and the football lad culture here and the type of people at those pubs, and bearing that in mind with your distate for him not being refined and the fact you have no issues with hobbies such as going to the theatre, you might want to consider if you've been inadvertently a bit class-ist to him. I don't know youre background or education level but it may be worth evaluating if you've got any negative biases as a result of a more privileged upbringing.

I mean football is enjoyed at all levels of income but the rougher down the pub, drinks with the lads, spitting on the floor and peeing against the alley wall, getting into drunken brawls uncouth image is found more in middle and lower class areas, but it's sorta seen as more lower class behaviour because it's, as you say, less refined. Even in media they're portrayed as those working blue collar/manual labour jobs normally. Think Smithy in Gavjn and Stacey.

"I read five sentences of your post and already saw you as overly judgemental, the reasons you disliked Matt were ridiculous and it appears like Matt came to dislike you because he could tell you disliked him or Ally had told him why you didn‚Äôt like him. I‚Äôm really confused how you can‚Äôt understand why Matt dislikes you, your post was the most judgemental thing I‚Äôve ever read.

You told her he was wrong for her because he swears and didn‚Äôt seem very refined like she was, so because he wasn‚Äôt raised in a posh family with a silver spoon in his mouth you instantly decided he wasn‚Äôt good enough for her. She likely told Matt what you said when they first met and he‚Äôs disliked you ever since simply because you disliked him for ridiculous overly judgemental reasons without even getting to know him.

So I don‚Äôt really understand why you‚Äôre hurt, your friend clearly told her partner what you originally said about him all those years before. Because you disliked
Him without even getting to know him, he developed a dislike towards you and his dislike is totally fair as why would he like someone who judged him before getting to know him.

Ally could fix all this though by telling Matt you‚Äôve changed your opinion and realised you were overly judgemental as his dislike is based on your original judgement of him. If anything you should be annoyed at Ally not Matt, not because she told him what you said when you first met him but because she hasn‚Äôt tried to fix things between the two of you by simply telling Matt though you were overly judgemental at first  you now want to get to know him without judgement.

The problem now seems to be your friend Ally. You‚Äôve realised you were overly judgemental and have changed your opinion, your willing to get to know Matt. Matt dislikes you because of your original judgement of him that you formed without getting to know him properly, he would likely forgive you but Ally clearly hasn‚Äôt told him you‚Äôve changed that view and he‚Äôs convinced you‚Äôre still the same person who‚Äôs judging him and likely thinks you only invite him for her benefit.

Your friend Ally seems two faced. She clearly told Matt what you originally said about him otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt have this opinion of you, fair enough she was honest with her partner but if it was just honestly she‚Äôd have told you  that she told him what you originally said all those years ago, yet she never told you she‚Äôd repeated what you said to Matt. She could also fix all this and get Matt to attend gatherings simply by telling him you‚Äôre inviting him because you‚Äôre sorry you judged him and you want to get to know him, but she‚Äôs clearly letting Matt think you haven‚Äôt changed and are only inviting him for her benefit.

I suggest talking to Ally and asking her to tell Matt you‚Äôre sorry for judging him and you wish to apologise and start over. If Ally‚Äôs not two faced she should be able to talk to Matt and bridge that gap. It is weird she‚Äôs not doing more to convince Matt you‚Äôre sorry and no longer the same overly judgemental person. She‚Äôs just letting him think you‚Äôre still the same way.. so I feel like what you‚Äôre missing is that Ally also thinks you‚Äôre overly judgemental but isn‚Äôt telling you because she doesn‚Äôt want to affect your friendship. 

Obviously I‚Äôm guessing based on limited information but I feel your friend is two faced and isn‚Äôt telling the truth that she agrees with Matt that you‚Äôre a judgemental person otherwise she could have just told him you‚Äôre not and that you were just been overly protective when he first met you which I truly believe though you acted crazy judgemental of someone coming from a background of less money, and ‚Äúrefined upbringing‚Äù part of it was you been protective of Ally but if she truly believed that she‚Äôd defend you to Matt and he‚Äôd attend gatherings, and give you a chance. It seems to me, Ally also believes you‚Äôre judging people unfairly who come from less entitled backgrounds and she doesn‚Äôt realise you were been protective and just views you as overly judgemental and is likely secretely angry at you for the way you judged Matt when you first met him and just hasn‚Äôt told you because she‚Äôd rather keep a friend she dislikes than end the friendship and be honest that she doesn‚Äôt seem to view you as the person you truly are and doesn‚Äôt like you as much as you like her.

Sorry if my opinion is harsh. I‚Äôm not trying to make you feel bad. Im also brutally honest.

You acting surprised that he dislikes you because Ally clearly told him you disliked him and judged him without even getting to know him makes you sound very narcissistic and this is likely why both of them don‚Äôt really want to be around you and don‚Äôt like you. Ally is just scared to let a friend go but if Matt formed that opinion, he formed it based on things she told him as he doesn‚Äôt really know you enough to decide you‚Äôre overly judgemental. Whatever Matt thinks, Ally also thinks. She‚Äôs holding on to a friendship she doesn‚Äôt truly want and seems two faced. You seem mildly narcissistic and somewhat delusional that you can‚Äôt even see it‚Äôs perfectly normal for someone to dislike you when you disliked them and talked behind their back for no actual real reason. Ally clearly repeated everything you said to Matt.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"so what happend here is actually not a scam.

the old price was 39.90. the item is NOT on sale. the price is permanently adjusted to 34.90. for a week after the price is adjusted to 34.90 the tag will be in orange (it reads ""NOW CHEAPER""). after that week the orange tag will be removed and the white tag beneath will stay with the ""now cheaper"" price of 34.90

the white tag is just prepared under the orange one in advance. you can check out the dates on the tags (bottom row) to see when they will be removed.

Generally the way it is installed is a multi tool is used to cut the casing of the door so the the LVP would slide under the casing nice and snug.

2. Un-click good planks until you get to this damaged imperfect plank. Un-click and cut casing up a tad with multi tool.  Usually its up to or approximately 1/4‚Äù cut. (The thickness of the flooring)
3. Cut new plank just long enough to cover all cut edges.  You could even cut the piece up closer to the marble.

The black cables with a single copper conductor are the wires for coax cable and probably go to every room in the house and a single run next to your outdoor electrical equipment for the cable company to hook up TV‚Äôs. 

These wires are usually installed by the builder to make wiring the house for phone, tv and/or internet easier and more reliable. If the providers know they are there they usually use them as the install is usually cleaner and easier.

Usually they get organized into a box like this, or smaller to distribute the cable, internet and TV. Sometimes more.

"In case anyone is wondering about the distinction between ‚Äúcatapult‚Äù and ‚Äútrebuchet‚Äù, I will explain. A catapult is any weapon that fires a projectile without the use of propellants or combustion. Yes, before you ask, by the very strictest application of that definition, that also included things like the bow and arrow. However, in common parlance, ‚Äúcatapult‚Äù generally refers to crew-served siege weapons. Moving on, an onager is a torsion-based siege weapon. This is usually what we refer to as a ‚Äúcatapult‚Äù. These are generally depicted as big wooden spoons on wheels that shoot rocks by releasing tension in the strings. A trebuchet is also a catapult. Generally, a trebuchet works by using centripetal force to throw a projectile from a sling attached to a long arm. There are two types of trebuchets that we normally see in media. The most common by far is the counterweight trebuchet, which uses a falling counterweight to generate that centripetal force to throw the projectile. The other type is the traction-trebuchet, this (and only this specific type of trebuchet) is also referred to as a mangonel. These function almost exactly like the counterweight version, but instead rely on a team of operators pulling ropes to swing the arm instead of using a falling weight. What we see in the video is a simple mangonel, with a single rope being used to swing the arm.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

Sure, as some of you have mentioned, the glass wall makes it look a little bit odd. But it's not like a peeping Tom is going to see anything past the distortion. Actually, you could probably detect changes quite well in the spatial volume behind the glass by keeping track of the caustics.

There was a small passageway between each unit that was accessible though the attic.  Lots of 2 way mirrors and hidden security cameras.  One room actually had a stripper pole in it with a vibrating bed and a jacuzzi tub. A couple of the hidden hallways had holes in the floor which were used for needle disposal.

"**Why is it blue?**

The lava from Indonesia's Kawah Ijen volcano has an electric blue appearance because of the combustion of sulfuric gases that are emitted from the volcano. These gases, which contain high levels of sulfur, ignite when they come into contact with oxygen at temperatures above 360¬∞C (680¬∞F). As the sulfuric gases burn, they produce a blue flame that illuminates the surrounding area and makes the lava appear to be blue. This phenomenon is known as ""blue fire"" and is a rare occurrence in the natural world.

"I've been there, it's so awesome to see it in real life. But to really be able to see the flames you will have to walk through the smoke with a gas mask and can only stay there for a few seconds until your eyes and nose will start to burn. Also the smell is disgusting. The local workers from the mines just walk straight into it (most of them without a mask) and will take your phone to take a picture of the blue flames for you.

"If you bought in December 2022, you‚Äôve only been in it for about 4 months, right? I‚Äôve only bought two houses in my life. Both were older homes. The first handful of months felt overwhelming as there were upfront costs for things that I or the inspector didn‚Äôt see before buying. Frequently those were not the ‚Äúfun‚Äù things to spend money on but the ones that felt like they really couldn‚Äôt be put off - roof, insulation, plumbing fixes, etc. 

All I‚Äôm saying is the first months are hard. You don‚Äôt have to fix everything you don‚Äôt like at once. You‚Äôve got time. Not saying that things won‚Äôt need repair or replacement after the first few months, but unexpected costs feel disproportionately large because you just invested so much money in buying the house. Try to focus on the positives, take on achievable chunks that make your everyday life more enjoyable, and even if you still want to move after 3 years you‚Äôll have spent that time with your home being as little of a stressor as possible.

Hope this helps. If I missed the mark, could you elaborate on what you don‚Äôt like about home ownership?",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

"When you go to sell, some buyers will stipulate a ‚Äúrider‚Äù. They may offer $465k but with a $5000 rider, meaning they will go $5000 over the appraised value. So if your house only appraises for $440k, they are willing to pay $445k. Thats how my realtor explained it to me.

Im currently selling and this is where I am. Accepted an offer of $260k on my townhome with a $5k rider. My realtor and I were not expecting the appraisal to hit $255k. Other comparable places in the area sold for $230k-$235k. Pretty surprised when my realtor told me we were getting the full offer.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1
"You‚Äôve already gotten a bunch of good responses and this is quite a bit later, but in case things weren‚Äôt clear: the appraisal was not done for *you.* Assuming you have a mortgage, the appraisal was done for the lender that funded your mortgage; to determine if the home you were buying was ‚Äúworth‚Äù what you were paying for it‚Ä¶ or more accurately what they were lending you. (Most lenders won‚Äôt loan more than 97% of the total value) a banks appraisal doesn‚Äôt mean anything for the sale price of a home. That‚Äôs determined by the market; more specifically the recent sale price of comparable homes (if the house next door to you is basically the same in terms of size and condition, and it just sold, it‚Äôs reasonable to expect that your house would sell for roughly the same amount). Pricing a home for sale is as much art as it is science as there isn‚Äôt a formal formula to plug variables into and produce a value.          
           
Home ownership is a challenge. Especially in the beginning (I have to buy how many lightbulbs? You mean I need blinds? And curtains?) I remember buying my first home and basically went from a 1bedroom studio to a 4bedroom house and it was completely empty for months except for my bedroom and a futon in the living room because I didn‚Äôt own a whole house worth of furniture and couldn‚Äôt afford to go out and buy a whole house worth of furniture in one shot‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll probably lose money (a lot of money) if you sell after 4 months.  Forget about the price of the house‚Ä¶ you paid closing costs on your mortgage when you bought it, and when you sell, there are sellers closing costs you have to pay (for the privilege of selling it) and between them that usually amounts to between 5-10% of the price (a bit more than half paid when you bought it and the remainder when you sell). And if you use a realtor (and you should) there‚Äôs also their commission to pay as well (generally 5-6%of the sale price)            
           
If you decide to sell in 2-3 years, the appraisal will mean even less than it means now, the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of your home will be based on the comparable homes recently sold and currently on the market at that time.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"Not to defend the US and their meddling tendencies but AMLO is not someone to be trust. Besides his empowerment of the military by giving them capability to meddle in internal security and the judicial system, his protection of generals and commanders accused of human rights abuses and involvement with drug cartels and his attacks on Mexico's electoral institute in order to weaken his supervisory and sanctioning powes, AMLO has demonstrated that he is at least sympathetic to Russia.

Being the leader of the left-wing Morena, AMLO has a typical anti-imperialist ideology regarding the global role of the United States of America, but his rejections of the sanctions on Russia, his critics regarding the US and European Union aid to Ukraine and the launch of Mexico-Russian friendship caucus by his party at congress clearly shows that he is considerably supportive of the Kremlin. The fact that Mexico is the largest host of GRU makes his statements and reaction fully hipocritical.

His actions are guided by ideological beliefs, especially the anti-Western imperialism current that dominates the Mexican left, explaining his simpathy to Putin and why some members of his party have supported Kremlin backed propaganda, this reached the point that a pro-government newspaper, La Jornada, has sow doubts regarding the war crimes committed by Russia.

Whereas in Europe the far-right is the one supportive of Russia, in Latin America it is the left-wing, Mexico is just a part of a bigger process in which populist authoritarian leaders emerged from both sides of the spectrum, being internationally supported by Putin through their shared mistrust and resentment of the West, either because of extreme nationalism or opposition to imperialism. 

In the country I am currently residing, Argentina, AMLO and Morena's equivalents are, respectively, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and the kirchnerist faction of the FdT (Frente de Todos/Front of Everyone). She has been historically supportive of Putin and the current government, headed by Alberto Fernandez, has tried to not attack or criticize Russia directly, going as far as to call the war a mutual agression. Even a major pro-government media C5N, openly accused NATO of being guilty of the conflict supported Russia's statements calling Ukraine a country ran by neonazis. Russia's vaccine diplomacy only exacerbated this trend by increasing our reliance of Russia.

This kind of statements and short-lived scandals are just excuses to slowly erode the country's ties with the US and the West due to their support of Putin's style of ruling and the model he implemented at Russia. Bolivia and Venezuela are the clearest examples of openly Russian backed regimes at Latin America and like Africa this continent has already become the scenario of a global ideological and geopolitical conflict that is beginning to heat up.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1

Camels can eat cactus with thorns, because their mouth is lined with papillae, nodules that create a rough structure and help with chewing and food flow. It is the same tough fibrous protein that makes up hair, fingernails, snake scales, porcupine quills, beaks, horns, hooves, etc. This adaptation allows these desert specialists to eat what little vegetation is provided by the hot, desolate environment they are accustomed to. It does hurt a camel to eat a thorny cactus, but they have adapted well to make it bearable.

Bactrian camels eat almost any kind of plant they find in their native habitat. They will also eat meat and fish if they have no choice. Their humps store fat, allowing them to survive with little food for extended periods of time",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Camels are otherworldly when it comes to adaptation. Not only are they extreme endurance animals that nearly rival humans, they are some of the most efficient water retenders on the planet.

"First things first.  Sit down and do your budget.   I cannot believe the amount of people that buy houses not realizing until later that they are house poor, and can't afford it.   So I highly suggest you do that first.  When you get your first month of bills you will be able to plan a little better.  We just went through this with my wifes friend.  She was ecstatic to get her first house on her own.   First month in the house and she is -500 every single month.  She did not sit down with a budget or plan.  We went through and made her a budget to minimize some of the red.  She will have to have a small part time gig, but at least she can keep her house for her kids.

With that out of the way you need to set some money aside for emergencies.  I have owned 3 houses over the years and I recommend 10k minimum for things in the house that break or you will replace eventually.  That may seem like a lot, but honestly it is expensive.

For example.  My current house in the first two years we have had to replace the water heater, furnace, ac, refrigerator, and we also had to completely gut the basement bathroom due to mold in the shower.  The owner built it incorrectly and that cost us about 4k to do ourselves.  Water heater was 800 bucks,  Furnace, ac was 10k.  We also need to replace all the deck boards, exteriors lights, counters in kitchen.  Roof, windows and siding are also very expensive.

It doesn't matter how old the house is you will need something eventually.  Also don't forget to clean the hair out of the shower or tub drain.  I bet it's clogged or full of stuff.  Ours was completely nasty.  I pulled out a softball sized chunk of nasty, slimey hair.

I also would recommend having additional money set aside to cover your salaries in the event one of you loses their job or has a job change with reduction in pay.  We are going through that right now.  My wife was at a job for almost 4 months and they decided to let her go.  She took a huge pay cut for a job she loves.  We are getting by but just barely.  So she is supplementing our income with instacart for a few months until she gets a raise.

When I bought my current house I bought it on just my salary.  I did not buy with my girlfriend at the time even though I knew we would get married.  I set a budget that I knew either of us could afford on one of our salary in the event one of us lost our jobs.  And it did happen to us about a month ago.  So glad we did that.  Sure we could have gotten a nicer house that had more space, etc.  But we would be in a world of hurt right now trying to come up with the extra money.  Stay within your means.   Take it from someone that has been there and lost everything when my first house was foreclosed.  It sucks and takes a while to get back on your feet.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"The comments here are all good OP. My personal emphasis: 

- know where your water shutoff, fire extinguisher, escape route, and ideally your sewer clean out are all located. 

- look at every mechanical item in your home and make sure you have a phone number for it (repair, replacement, service) so you don‚Äôt need to stress about that when you need to call for help. 

- I bought my first house solo at 28; the first night I stayed there we had a huge windstorm and I could hardly sleep thinking ‚Äòoh fuck if something goes through the roof I legit have NO IDEA what to do first, I need to answer those questions before they‚Äôre asked of me!!! Seriously, you cannot go wrong developing some emergency plans. What do you need in case of a fire? A flood? A burglar? An electrical issue? Power outage? Trust me, life is so much easier when you have contingency plans in place. 

- save. Save money. More than you think. Definitely start setting aside some savings for unexpected house emergencies. I didn‚Äôt think I needed to replace my roof when I did, and then a hurricane hit, I lost a few shingles, and while buddy was up there replacing them he mentioned that they were sun-baked and would be toast within a year. Wham, a lot of thousands of dollars later, I‚Äôm just really glad I had the income at the time to make that happen. 

- there are so many things you can learn to DIY that will save you infinite time and money. Replacing a faucet is jokes. They come with idiot proof instructions. A few tools and knowing how to shut off your water and boom, you don‚Äôt need no stinkin plumber. I‚Äôm always always happy to field questions about this- I‚Äôve almost single-handedly overhauled my whole ass house, down to the studs in some areas. 

- when considering updates, focus on utility first. HVAC. Power. Plumbing, wiring, insulation, waterproofing. Actually go back and put waterproofing higher on that list. Water is the enemy. You can replace your kitchen cabinets but it won‚Äôt count for shit if you‚Äôve got a wonky valve upstairs that busts and soaks them all later down the road",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"Find your main water shut off and learn how to use it. 

Find the electrical panel and get acquainted with how to reset breakers and where the main shutoff at the electrical panel is. Sometimes when a breaker goes off (‚Äúpops‚Äù) it only moves a little bit (to the right I believe) so it is barely out of line with the other breakers. It‚Äôs hard to tell. Reset the one out of line. Label your breakers if they‚Äôre not already labeled. 

Assuming you got a home inspection read it carefully. There are usually some pearls of wisdom there along with insight into how your specific house systems work.

Don‚Äôt be intimidated if something breaks. There is so much on you tube now that you can fix almost anything. Just stay away from electricity unless you‚Äôre an electrician, except resetting the occasional breaker. In that case, if a breaker pops often, have an electrician look at it. You might have a short somewhere.

The most important one:  Make sure your smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are working and located correctly.

One way to think about it in the past few centuries is by looking at the age of enlightenment and its impact on slavery. I have no doubt everyone will agree that society grew greater when slavery was abolished.

Writers, artists, academics and politicians during the enlightenment (18th centuryish) all started seeding some very new ideas of what a nation-state was, what the rights of the individual human were, etc

That's why European countries were the first to outlaw slavery.

Slavery had existed in every society since the dawn of time. It was routine, unquestioned. But when old men planted the idea that ALL humans could have inalienable rights, suddenly the idea of humans as property became increasingly untenable.

Enlightenment scholars knew they would not themselves see a world without slavery. But they planted that seed and it led to Britain, the Netherlands and other European powers being the first to outlaw slavery world-wide.

They then were the first to enforce it using their navy, while the rest of the world slowly caught up.

"History was never my strongest subject, so I asked Gpt... I guess I'll weather the down votes for this 'woke' answer because I still find it amusing:

The Greek proverb ""A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in"" emphasizes the importance of long-term thinking and selflessness for the betterment of society as a whole. Here are a few examples of individuals or groups who exemplified this philosophy in human history:  
Founding Fathers of the United States - The founding fathers of the United States, such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams, laid the foundations of the country's democratic institutions and constitutional framework. They were aware that the fruits of their labor would not be fully realized in their lifetimes, but they worked tirelessly to create a system that would endure for generations to come.  
Environmentalists and Conservationists - Environmentalists and conservationists have worked to preserve natural resources and protect ecosystems for the benefit of future generations. The establishment of national parks, protected areas, and wildlife sanctuaries is a testament to their efforts to ensure that future generations can enjoy the natural beauty of the planet.  
Scientists and Innovators - Many scientists and innovators have dedicated their lives to developing new technologies and discoveries that will benefit society in the long term. For example, Marie Curie's pioneering work in radioactivity and radiation therapy has had a profound impact on medicine, and the development of the internet has revolutionized communication and access to information.  
Philanthropists - Philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett have made enormous contributions to society through their charitable giving. Their donations to education, health, and social welfare programs have improved the lives of countless people and will continue to do so long after they are gone.  
These are just a few examples of individuals and groups who have planted trees whose shade they knew they would never sit in, and whose legacies have contributed to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"In Greenville South Carolina, early government officials invested into their water systems. Greenville water supply comes from Table Rock and another area that I forgot the name. BUT today we are focusing on Table Rocks treatment plant. The geology of the lake under this mountain range is like a stone bowl, perfect for collecting water. So they pass policy that protected their water ways riparian zone. This zone is protected woods full of plant life. When it rains, the water flows through the plant life acts like filtration into the lake. Today, the water treatment plant barely has to filter out the water. They actually use charcoal in this process.

All dirt taken out from this new road would eventually be taken to the bottom of the cliff in San Isidro, Miraflores and Barranco and would serve to build a road that goes along the coast and which gives Lima its popular city beaches (Bedoya was not involved in this project, though). For a long while, the low-level road known as Via Expresa would be the only three-lane high-speed road to cross the city from North(ish) to South(ish). In the 80s terrorism took over the highlands of Peru and a lot of people moved to Lima making population go up to 10 million inhabitants as it is right now.

"The proverb ""A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in"" reflects the idea of selfless sacrifice for the greater good of future generations. Here are some of the greatest examples of that:

Founding of the American nation: The founding fathers of the United States, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison, created a government and Constitution that have been instrumental in shaping American society for over two centuries. They knew they would not live to see the full effects of their efforts but planted the seeds for a nation that has long since become the most powerful on earth.

Establishment of the University of Bologna: In 1088, a group of scholars in the city of Bologna, Italy, established the University of Bologna. This institution would go on to become one of the most prestigious centers of higher learning in the world.

Development of modern medicine: The work of scientists such as Louis Pasteur, Jonas Salk, and Alexander Fleming has led to the development of modern medicine. These medical pioneers developed vaccines and antibiotics that have saved countless lives around the world.

The creation of the World Wide Web: The World Wide Web was developed in the late 20th century by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee. His invention revolutionized the way people communicate and access information, and its effects continue to be profound and far-reaching in our society.

The abolition of slavery: The abolition of slavery is a long and ongoing struggle, but it has made significant strides since the 19th century. People such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and William Wilberforce were instrumental in the movement to end slavery, even when they knew they might not live to see its full eradication.

These are just a few examples of people who planted ""trees"" whose ""shade"" they knew they would never sit in. They dedicated their lives to creating a better future for others, and their contributions continue to impact society today.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

>Norman Ernest Borlaug (/Ààb…îÀêrl…îÀê…°/; March 25, 1914 ‚Äì September 12, 2009)\[3\] was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.  
  
Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties.\[1\]\[2\] During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations.\[4\]  
  
Borlaug was often called ""the father of the Green Revolution"",\[5\]\[6\] and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.\[7\]\[8\]\[9\]\[10\] According to Jan Douglas, executive assistant to the president of the World Food Prize Foundation, the source of this number is Gregg Easterbrook's 1997 article ""Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity."" The article states that the ""form of agriculture that Borlaug preaches may have prevented a billion deaths.""\[11\] He was awarded the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supply.  
  
Later in his life, he helped apply these methods of increasing food production in Asia and Africa.\[12\]",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

"That's impressive work for a 23 year old, kudos.

One thing I see so many people do is go ""house poor."" IE, buying a massive home and spending a large portion of your income on your mortgage.

I bought a home in my early 20s that was far below what I could afford, thinking it would be shorter term. Similar income as your current. I lived there for nearly 20 years, even as I progressed through my career, up through being an executive vice president within a global organization.

My (all in) $800/month mortgage payment was such a blessing for so long, until I paid it off in half the length of the term.

Even before I got to an executive level in my career, I was able to dine out, travel, have nice furnishings, clothing, the list goes on. Allowed nice appliances, some remodels, updates and repairs to the home as needed.

Met my wife, and we were able to start our marriage out without really the stress of finances. Traveled a bit more, enjoyed our lifestyle even more.

I didn't have to really worry about living expenses, through good times and bad, due to not maxing myself (or ourselves) out.

Automobile financing was paid off quickly. We were able to help both our mother's out, and into homes. Our nieces and nephews were a bit spoiled as well.

Please be smart about your purchase. It can be truly an asset or a liability.

Don't drop your entire $65k on your down payment. Shoot for half, and keep yourself comfy for a very long time.

"From repair clinic‚Äôs website: 
Whirlpool Refrigerator Water Inlet Valve
The water inlet valve requires a minimum of 20 psi to shut off properly. If the water pressure is too low, the valve may not close fully once the power is shut off. As a result, the valve will leak water into the ice maker and cause the ice maker to overflow. Check the water pressure to determine if it is at least 20 psi. If the water pressure is sufficient, the water inlet valve is likely defective. The valve may not shut off all the way or may be stuck open, causing water to leak through the valve. If the water pressure is sufficient, but the ice maker is still overflowing, replace the water inlet valve.‚Å†
I‚Äôd check the flow rate of the supply line and check it for kinks, and check the screen where it connects to the fridge for a blockage before condemning the water inlet valve.",1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1

"I am not a lawyer.  It seems to me that all you want is for them to keep their trash from your yard.

Start with talking politely to the management about it.  Maybe they can move their can, and all is solved.

If you want to motivate them, when you talk to them, get the company contact info so you can send them letters if need be.  Now you can send legal letters should you really escalate this.

Forming your own trash removal company will allow you to generate invoices so you can ""pay"" for you to pick up their trash from your property.  A nasty lawyer can help you pad the bill with ""show up fees"" and ""minimum work hours"" for your company with you filling every corporate position and needing compensation for each job (ceo, accountant, diversity hiring consultant, worker, safety supervisor, etc., etc.).  This could make each trash removal expensive.  This means a big bill they need to pay you to pick up their trash.

Court time will cost them lawyer fees at a minimum, even small claims court,  and a slow news week may get them bad publicity.  All of which will be motivation for them to take actions to keep more of their own money and fix the issue.

All the legal stuff, including video recording and what not should be discussed with legal pros.

But, just talking with the manager might get everything fixed or you could consider the trash pickup as your exercise and just keep doing it yourself.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"Hire one of the companies you‚Äôve had out to do either the liquid treatments or put in bait stations.  You should be able to get what‚Äôs called a termite bond. It‚Äôs basically an annual inspection and treatment plan as needed to keep termites out of your home. The bond makes sure that company at the least will warranty the work so that IF the termites do get to your home they will kill the termites in the structure at no cost.  Some companies will even as part of being on an annual service/bond with them guarantee no termites will get to your home and if they do the company will kill those termites and repair any damage done.  The bond will also make your home more attractive to potential buyers. 

In my area of the southeast termite bonds are very common.  The setup / first treatment may cost around $1k but after that it‚Äôs about $300/yr to keep up the treatment.

Again, ***at ONE in the morning.***  After probably having been sound asleep, until they saw what looked like pleas for help and coupled with NO response from you when they texted to see if you were okay.

He didn't come to the party to party.  He came to the party because your ""inside jokes"" were badly done and irresponsible and he believed your stupid texts.

"Wow. You really took it here?

It may be frowned upon to address this on here but since you started it on this platform, then I guess I'll join you.

First, I'm reading a lot of comments accusing her of being kicked out of her previous housing. She wasn't. There was a mold issue in her apartment and she's crashing at our house for a week or so (at least) while they get new rooms prepared. I will vouch for her there.

Secondly, honest to goodness she is a smart young woman. She doesn't go to wild parties, she's very careful about the company she keeps. I hate that she drinks underage but she is careful about it. Our parents raised you to be wise and independent which is WHY the snaps scared *me* so badly. You don't pull stunts like this. This is so beyond who I know you to be. I don't use snapchat. Hubby woke me up and asked me my thoughts. After you didn't text back I said we needed to go get you because none of this is like you.

Now, I was perfectly fine coming to get you myself. However, we are down to a rental car because last week YOUR brother-in-law and I got our car totaled in an accident and only he can drive the rental for now. So if you're mad, be mad at me. Leave him out of it. Anyone commenting echoing that he is a creep... just stop it.

I'm so livid because we JUST got out of a situation where we were being harassed which is why we were both afraid something was seriously wrong. We're still scared out of our minds from our experience. Am I projecting that onto you? Probably, but I'm not sorry for it.

I love you with my whole heart and we are going to get over this nonsense that was completely blown out of proportion. But I am so disappointed that instead of coming to me (us) you chose to air this out like this. It doesn't feel good to see people calling you out of your name like this, but you've really given me no reason to defend you.

Let's see it from your sister's view:


You're living with your husband and having a dandy time until your little sister wants to move in because it's closer to college, cheaper and she doesn't have to stick to typical dorm rules.


You agree. She's your little sister, it'd be nice having her around. Plus you know how she feels, she's just starting out in the world and God knows you had to learn the hard way. 

.
She doesn't have to. You can help her become independent and steer through the way without stumbling. You can provide her the comfort every new adult craves. You can feed her, take her shopping, and you won't be imposing rules like your mother might.


So you bring her home. It's going great, she's making tons of friends and you're happy too. She tends to act a little childish sometimes but it's okay because you can guide her. 'This doesn't mean you're her mother'. You're simply acting as a responsible adult.



You don't place any curfews, and she gets to enjoy life. She goes out at a party, and you're not worried. As long as she's safe and having fun.


Until your husband sees her snap. ""That's weird, it seems as if she wants to come home"", he says. Hmmm. Maybe she does want to, you should text her.


So you do. You text her, hoping everything is okay. She doesn't reply. Now it's 12 AM ans you're worried af. You know she's a responsible adult.. but what if she was really wanting to come home? What if someone pressured her to stay? What if someone's pressuring her to do some other stuff and she's relying on her family?



Maybe she can't get to the phone cause she's drunk. But what if her friends abandoned her? What if she needs a ride home but she's too drunk? 


Or maybe you're overreacting.  But it's 12:30 and still no reply. Her last snaps say she'd rather be home.


You don't want to ruin her party but oh God what if something went wrong? Well, it's 12:45 now and you better ask your husband to help.


We'll just check on her. So you do. But she thinks you're crazy and blows up on you. You still think she should come home. But not because you're controlling. But because as much as she's capable of handling herself, you need to ensure she does want to party, and not just because she's drunk right now and going with the flow.



But she calls you whatnot, blows up on you and your husband and thinks you're the asshole.
.




.
.
OP, I get it, you're young and you want to be independent. It seems to you as if your sister and BIL are taking away your adulthood by being protective. But they're not.


They did everything, absolutely right. They aren't molly-coddling you or pestering you like you think. They're literally concerned because you're family.


Anyone sane who sees your snaps WILL think you wanted to leave. An inside joke is supposed to be discussed with the people you share it with, not EVERYONE.  So you don't get to place the blame on them for being concerned.


They did everything right. You might be an adult, but they are kind of like your guardians because you're staying with them. You get to be your own person, but they get to care.


They were nice enough to show up when you're probably in danger because  HOW THE FUCK WILL THEY KNOW IT'S AN INSIDE JOKE?


Apologise to them. And realize the difference between someone controlling you and caring for you.

And thank them for being considerate and caring.

I'm in college finishing my first year. I moved in with my sister and her husband after losing my campus housing first semester. I try to be a good housemate but sometimes get annoyed because they try to act like my parents on occasion. Our agreement is that they're supposed to treat me like an adult roommate, not their child.

Case and point. I went to a college party Sunday night.  I was also posting on SnapChat and stupidly had maps on for all my friends which includes my sister and BIL. It was about 12 midnight or so, long after they go to bed and I posted some snaps I meant as JOKES like ""get me out of this party"" ""this is the worst"" ""I just want to go homeeee"" because we all were doing it as like an inside joke that came out of the party but I was 100% fine. I guess my sister saw them and texted and asked if I was okay but I didn't see the text til much later. I don't mind that she did this.

Well around 1 AM who do I see walking in the door but my lovely BIL and my sister is waiting in their car. He said he saw the snaps and asked if I was okay. He also told me to give him my car key and to get an Uber home. I called him controlling and a creep for coming to a college party when he graduated years ago and is a d\*mn adult man. He wouldn't leave until I gave him my key even though I kept yelling at him. He finally left when I gave him my car key. My sister of course got pissed trying to say he was just looking out for me but I think they need to mind their business.

Why did you ""lose your housing""? Because the only way you lose campus housing, if you've already secured your funds (my loans covered my tuition and housing, and then some, so if I was in college because my loans paid my tuition, then my housing was paid as well), is by getting kicked out. There are numerous ways to do this, but I feel like it takes a lot. Like a lot of repeated ""small"" infractions or one big thing that was pretty bad. 

It seems like you are probably pretty lucky they let you stay with them in the first place. It's funny how you mention the rules for you to live there. So the ONLY rule is the one YOU set for THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THE HOME AND ARE ALLOWING YOU TO LIVE THERE, which is that they must treat you like an adult? So, you don't have any rules at all, set by them for you to follow? Such as, perhaps, having the courtesy to respond if you're out late and they ask if you're alright? Or letting them know if you won't be coming home that night? Or what about ""no drinking and driving""? 

It seems like you had every intention of driving under the influence. So, BIL was totally justified in refusing to leave until you've surrendered your key. You are lucky him and your sis love you so much. Then you think he's the one who acted silly and embarrassed himself by showing up to a college party? How about how you screamed at him in front of your friends, repeatedly? How, if you simply had given him your key in the first place, he would have left right away, but instead you yelled at him repeatedly like that was going to get you what you wanted. Like a toddler. And the fact that you were stubbornly arguing with him against your own well being! A mature adult would NOT have gotten defensive if their BIL showed up after they broadcast an SOS for help. If it was such a joke, or prank I guess, then that would have been funny! You and your friends would have laughed and tried to get him to play a round of beer pong. Then, when he said he wanted your key so he knows you won't drive drunk, a mature adult would have known he was right, and given the keys. You behaved like a child.

Most people would not tolerate that bs. Your sister and BIL have better things to do than staying up at night worrying about you for apparently no reason, only to be abused for it. Get over yourself. Your friends just caught a glimpse of what you're like. If you've known them for a long time, they probably already know how immature you are and discuss it openly when you're not around.

"*pinches bridge of my nose*

Hon, do you understand that if you were deeply inebriated, or drugged, or roofied, then Snapchat might have been the only way you could think to communicate? Your insistence that ""but if I were really in danger, I would've texted!"" is based on the false assumption that you would be operating at full mental capacity. Maybe all you could've done through the rohypnol-haze was (1) post a picture from earlier in the night with (2) a plea for help.

""But all the other girls were doing it!"" Cool. Does your sister follow those girls? Could she easily see that this was a big in-joke? Seems unlikely.

""But it was a small get-together of trusted friends!"" Cool. All it takes is one predator, though. An older brother, a sketchy boyfriend, a dangerous father, a shitty landlord. Would you rather your sister just assume you were fine??

""There weren't any drugs being used!"" Cool. They were supposed to know this how, exactly? You posted a picture of a board game with the caption that you *needed to leave*. Were they supposed to ignore your clearly-stated needs just because there weren't any drug paraphernalia directly in the shot?

""He thinks I'm an idiot who would drink and drive!"" You had been drinking and then posted *multiple* messages saying you wanted and intended to leave, presumably by driving. He took you at your word.

Social media is not the place for these kinds of ""in-jokes"", because the audience is public and therefore isn't ""in"" on the private joke. You did a stupid, immature thing by posting that you needed to leave when you didn't. Your sister and BIL showed up to help because they were worried about you. You repaid them with really gross disdain. Calling him a creep, really?? You have no idea how lucky you are, and people are angry with you because you sound spoiled and entitled.

"YTA.  I'm not going to harp on why since everyone else seems to have that covered, but I do want to say one thing that I hope you'll look at with mature eyes:

&#x200B;

Pictures and captions that say different things are going to raise eyebrows for everyone.   
 Lots of people your age get themselves into positions they don't know how to get out of.   
 Your sister saw not-scary pictures with scary captions, and when she asked if you were okay and you didn't respond, she got worried.  You're blaming your BIL for a lot, but your sister was right in the thick of things too, and you don't seem to be blaming her for much at all, which seems incredibly unfair.  

But then you also say you feel insulted because he demanded your keys after learning you had been drinking... look at it from his point of view.  He should be asleep at home, but instead his wife is asking him to please go with her to chase after her kid sister (who doesn't even like him) because mixed signals are being sent out and his wife can't figure out if you're safe or not.  So then he gets there, *while he should be sleeping*, just to see that everything is fine after he had gotten himself all riled up wondering what potentially horrible thing he was going to find.  Just to find out that no, everything's completely fine, the kid sister who doesn't like him was just being immature, presumably because she was drinking.  

So if she's immature enough to scare the crap out of her older sister/his wife, what else is she too immature for?  You told him you were going to sleep there, but all he knows is that you've been drinking, you don't like him, you're unhappy and getting angry, he's tired, and he's unhappy and getting angry too, which is a terrible combination that all leads to him not being able to trust that you're not just trying to get rid of him.  **Very few people think their loved ones are stupid enough to drink and drive, but very many people lose their loved ones to drinking and driving.**  If you HAD just been trying to get rid of him, and if you had tried to drive home just to hurt yourself, he would have never, ever forgiven himself.  Your family would have never, ever forgiven him.  

You made a lot of mistakes that night, and yeah, I'll bet he wasn't in the best headspace to be particularly fair by the time you all got to that point, but most of that was because of you.  And if you wanted him to leave quickly, all you had to do was give him the keys to the car you swore you had no intention of using anyways.  Give him the keys, let him go away, and then once you got home the next day you could have had a conversation.  Instead you were the catalyst of a bad situation, and then you actively made the bad situation worse by causing even more of a scene instead of just being grateful that you have people who love and care enough about you to make sure you're okay... when you say you aren't before going silent.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

1.) You ask to be treated like an adult. That doesn't automatically mean that any concern for you is thrown out the window. Roommates (should) care for each other in some way shape or form in order to create a good relationship with each other. It wouldn't be weird if they were just people you lived with. The fact that they are family makes this entirely worse. Why would you, an ""adult"", throw a tantrum for people that are making sure you're okay? Are you aware of the many instances, some leading to death,  of people getting taken advantage of at parties? They were worried. Not because of some ""parental authority"" you think they feel over you. But because of jokes you posted declaring you needed help to get out that party.  Put in account that one of these people with concern for you was your SISTER, and that makes you seem like a major AH.

2.) Even as an adult, its always good to make sure people that you trust (like family) know where you are in case something bad happens and you don't have much control to leave the situation. You could have been almost blackout drunk posting snaps and that location being the last place they've heard from you. So of course they pop up there seeing as you never responded or acknowledged their messages or whatever. Its not rocket science.

3.) You're also ungrateful. They arent living with you. You are living with them. Under their roof (by the way you worded things). Tbh who gaf about the agreement? You lost your campus housing and they opened their arms to you and this is how you treat them? Just for caring about your wellbeing?

You being at a small party with college friends would actually be a very sensible time to use social media in that way from their POV, because your sister and BIL could infer that you didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward for your friends by calling the cops and getting everyone busted for underage drinking or risking social ramifications or getting any of your friends arrested or fined or ticketed, and where you might just want out. 

Just because your friends are doing something i.e. sharing snaps with fake cries for help doesn‚Äôt mean you should. You literally did the boy who cried wolf. 

And also? You made more of a scene by refusing to hand over your keys, because your pride was more important (taking you at your word that you wouldn‚Äôt drive). If you weren‚Äôt going to drive and you wanted it resolved with minimal fuss, just hand over your damn keys. Given you‚Äôd just cried wolf, of course they‚Äôre not going to believe you, especially when you start fighting them on it because you think they‚Äôre cramping your style.

Given you don‚Äôt pay market rent and your BIL and sister saved your ass with housing, you really need to grovel to both of them. 

What you‚Äôre not getting is that your sister and BIL have more years and have learned that a) cops aren‚Äôt always safe, b) sometimes it isn‚Äôt possible to get out of somewhere by just calling and you need to send a covert message, and c) that it just isn‚Äôt fucking worth ignoring a message like that / assuming it is a joke and maybe losing their sister forever or her going through a traumatic experience.

you sent out distress messages

Your BIL and sister try to reach out to you to confirm if it's real or a joke

You ignore them. You also don't post anything else to contradict the SOS. No lol, just kidding, s/. 

They believe the messages are real and come to rescue you.

You're situationally fine, not sober and annoyed someone responded to an emergency message like it's an emergency. You tell him go away and call him.a creep.

You BIL, knowing you aren't sober, asks for your car keys.

You say I don't need to. I'm going to stay the night here.

Your BIL, that you JUST lied to, does not believe you and takes your key to make sure what you say is true / you have to get an uber so you can't drive drunk.

What you fail to see is YOU SUMMONED BIL. 

It's the equivalent of commissioner Gordon wanting a quiet night / alone time on the roof of the police station. He then turns on the bat signal. Batman shows up. Gordon gets ticked and demands to know what Batman is doing there?

"YTA for two reasons.

Firstly is the same reason as everyone pointed out in the comments.

Secondly is your title is singling out the BIL when it was your sister in equal responsibility. You're simply not being fair. Calling him a creep in front of all these young people is horrible. Did you do the same to your sister?",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1
"YTA and reading your comments just confirm that you really don‚Äôt understand how lucky you are that you have family that worries about you enough to see a snap that said ‚Äúget me out of this party‚Äù(no matter how sarcastic you tried to make it) and then came in case you needed them when you didn‚Äôt answer a text.  And it boggles my mind you think it makes them the AH here because they worried about you and wanted to make sure you were safe. 

You‚Äôre mad that they don‚Äôt trust you and they treat you like a child.  Well I hate to break it to you, but you‚Äôre behaving like a child.  You posted something that asked for help, and then you didn‚Äôt answer a text.  You get mad that they want your keys cause you‚Äôre obviously intoxicated? Cause ‚Äúyou‚Äôd never drink and drive‚Äù but there plenty or people out there who have said that and do it anyway. Or people who have thought they were safe to drive and then weren‚Äôt. 

Right now you feel embarrassed by their actions but think about it like this.  In a couple months you‚Äôre at a party and you‚Äôve been drinking and someone is there that is making you feel uncomfortable or has even gone as far as assaulting you in one way or another.  That person is near by and you need help but you‚Äôre scared that they might retaliate if you call 911 or call for help.  So you make a post that asks for help but shows you having ‚Äúfun‚Äù.  But this time when your sister and BIL see the snap they don‚Äôt text and ask if you‚Äôre okay and they don‚Äôt come because last time it was just a joke and you verbally berated them for coming to your aid.  And while they‚Äôre at home thinking ‚Äúoh OP and her friends just have another inside joke‚Äù you‚Äôre at this party praying someone sees that post and comes to your rescue.  And help NEVER comes. 

You think parties can‚Äôt go sideways all of a sudden? Parties that start out chill can end very differently.  It happens ALL THE TIME.  No one goes out and assumes they‚Äôre going to be assaulted, but it happens every day.  OP you cried wolf and someone came to your aid.  And while I hope it never happens, you might not be so lucky when you actually need help. 

I honestly hope you sit down and really look at how you reacted here.  That you take the time to read every single one of these comments. Especially the ones talking about how someone needed to be subtle or cryptic to get help to get them out of a situation.  How there are countless examples of people using code to get help because it was not safe to ask for help directly.  How they had to make it look like nothing was wrong and that they were having a great time.  And then you need to apologize profusely to your sister and BIL. You need to talk to them about how you didn‚Äôt realize the way your snaps might be perceived since they weren‚Äôt there for the inside joke. And you need to thank them for being willing to come to your rescue in the middle of the night.  Because I guarantee at least one of them knows someone who has needed help at a party at one time or another.  You‚Äôre not invincible OP and you need to remember that bad things can happen to anyone no matter how prepared you are.  

Side note: If you want to post things like that in the future then maybe you need to come up with a code word that you can use in a snap or a text that will let them know you need help.  It should be something that is easily put into texts but not used by you every day.  I have one with my friends, my husband, and my SIL. And I hope none of us have to use it.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"YTA. Big time and while you are getting burned for it I‚Äôll explain it like this - 

 I moved home after the military to start college and save money (23). I truly knew I was an adult because I was out to the clubs and had told my parents I‚Äôd home be around 1-130. 

Welp some of my friends were really up for a loonnngggg night - and I knew I was going to be out longer. it was 12ish, I excused myself (slightly tipsy), went to a pay phone (yeah yeah) and called to leave a message to my parents on their machine that I was staying out later and was safe. 

It wasn‚Äôt that they were treating me like a child- I just didn‚Äôt want them to worry that I wasn‚Äôt home prior to my original plan. So. As an adult, I called so they wouldn‚Äôt have to wonder. 

So- your actions were alarming, you didn‚Äôt respond when they reached out worried  and got shitty when the people in your life came to see to your safety. Are those the actions of an adult? Think about it, atone and take steps to be the adult you want to be treated as",1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1

And if something is supposed to be shared as a joke, it should actually be funny.  I don't know how many times I've seen posts where an inside joke ends up hurting, excluding or causing anxiety for people.

Inside the boiler there is a tankless hot water coil and that had a small leak, so it was constantly leaking fresh water into the closed loop heating system. It started out slow so it would take a few weeks before the pressure really built up, then over time it progressed to a few days. I would just relieve pressure from the system from the relief valve to keep it in line. 

Most of the cost of the replacement was in the labor since our system was rather old and corroded and they have to take it all apart. If I remember right it was about $800 to replace the coil 3 years ago.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1

Also, flappers have hard water buildup that breaks the seal. Take it off and wipe it/ clean with CLR. Flappers on my well water last about 6 years.  Second, the float can get mineral buildup on it, and now it weighs more and won‚Äôt float properly. Clean it off so the float works as designed. 

Lastly, the tank internals like the tower/float, I would replace after 10 years, not expensive. That way you can work on the toilet when you want to, rather than work on it when you HAVE to.

"It would be too easy to start with clear antagonists or the likes, but as far as ""friendly"" characters go, two from Cyberpunk 2077 come to mind: Johnny and Claire.

Now Johnny is the easy one, because the fact that he is an terrorist egomaniac and all around horrible person isn't that concealed, but Claire takes the cake with starting off extremely nice and likeable until you figure out how horrid she is.

This woman, who takes part in races where she shoots gleefully at other cars, wants you to kill a guy during such a race who, according to her, killed her husband. How did he do that? Why, doing one of these death races where people shoot each other. Okay, now you might think: ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"", until you figure he wasn't shot in the race, but no, the guy in question hit the breaks while in front of them forcing them to crash, and she thinks this is intentional. 

Now, you can tell her: ""Okay try and kill him during the race, but we are going to finish the race"". In a scripted event during the race, the target will crash and have to leave the race, and she will prompt you to abandon the race and go out to kill him even if you told her you want to win. If you do win, she will hate you, there is no remedy to this, and she is the bartender of the game's biggest bar where she'll now refuse to serve you because you failed to entertain her revenge fantasy. Yes, previous dialogue choices can lead to her confronting the crashed guy and not killing him, but that again depends on previous dialogue choices. 

I just want an option where you stop her from kill the guy by, well, shooting her as she's about to pull the trigger (and do mind you during the confrontation, the target is incapacitated and does not fight back whatsoever).",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

"The problem I have, and I've been playing since the original harvest moon is your success as a farmer is exponential, first you have 1 crop, than 2, then 5, then 10, then 100, I feel like there there is an opportunity  to add some extra difficulty.

"I've never been into farming games in general. I think the game really hits hard for a certain kind of gamer that gets really into the systems it presents. For me, any time there is a time mechanic (stores are only open at certain times.. people are only available to chat at certain times) it really doesn't make me want to play it. The game has a certain grind to it and you either really connect with it or you don't really connect with it at all. The ""Harvest Moons"" and ""Animal Crossings"" and any game that relies on ""crafting"" as a heavily feature mechanic just don't do it for me.   


I don't really want a life simulator but I would love for things from this genre just without some of the pretense. Like A link to the Past, but also there's more to do than just defeat monsters and bosses.

"RDR2 is the culmination of the best-funded game company on the planet, gonna have to wait for GTA 6 for something to bring the heat in the same way.

Rdr2 and the Witcher 3 hit different,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - This game offers a rich, open-world experience with a deeply engaging story, well-developed characters, and a vast amount of side quests. Similar to RDR2, it immerses players in a detailed world, and the choices made throughout the game impact the story's outcome.

The Last of Us & The Last of Us Part II - These action-adventure games feature a strong narrative, memorable characters, and an emotional journey. They share RDR2's focus on storytelling and character development while offering a unique post-apocalyptic setting.

God of War (2018) - This action-adventure game offers a captivating story, deep character development, and a beautiful world to explore. Similar to RDR2, it focuses on the relationship between the protagonist and another central character, leading to a heartfelt and immersive experience.

Horizon Zero Dawn - This open-world action RPG features a compelling story, a unique setting, and a strong female protagonist. It shares RDR2's emphasis on exploration and world-building, and its narrative keeps players engaged throughout the game.

Mass Effect Trilogy - This sci-fi action RPG series is known for its branching narrative, deep character development, and player choices that impact the story. Although set in a different genre, it shares RDR2's commitment to immersive storytelling and memorable characters.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey - This open-world action RPG offers a vast world to explore, a gripping story, and engaging gameplay. It shares similarities with RDR2 in terms of world-building and character development, allowing players to become deeply invested in the narrative.

These games are recommended based on their engaging stories, strong character development, and immersive worlds. Although they may not be exactly like RDR2, they share key aspects that could appeal to someone who enjoyed the storytelling and emotional investment found in Red Dead Redemption 2",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1
"I have 60 hours in RDR2 and here are my toughts about it:

Story was too long, some entire chapters like the island part should not be in game.

Rockstar's quest design is borderline insulting. Not only you have to do things the way rockstar tells you (you can't just hide, you need to hide in the marker), almost every quest boils down to same thing with different dialogue. Here are quest types that i remember:

Rescue,run away while shooting.

Shoot a group of enemies, run away while shooting.

Sneak, get into a fight, run away while shooting.

Get into vehicle, shoot while vehicle is running.

Press button to play animation, move, do it again. This usually ends up with, you guessed right, run away while shooting.

Story is a cliche but presented very well.

World is lively but too gamefied. You will know what i mean when the exact same encounter runs past you the 60th time.

Graphics are nicely done, a bit too gamey in some parts but not overly exaggerated.

Everything plays an animation. Everything. It is nice the first time arthur plays the looting animation, not when he does it for 200th time. You can't skip them. Very annoying. Probably the worst part about the game apart from the insulting quest design.

I have to say this again, quest design is horrible. It is garbage. It treats the player as if they are 10 year old max. Or let me put it this way, you don't need to listen to dialogue or read quest log, just move to the yellow marker or shoot enemies. That's it really.

&#x200B;

Overall, i would give it 6/10 maybe 7 if i'm feeling really generous. It looks nice, has a   
well made presentation of it's story but the actual gameplay and quests are insultingly bad. Rockstar imo should've put more time into random encounter and quest design than the million unskippable animations they put in to the game.",1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"As far as story, it is pretty unmatched at least off the top of my head. GTA IV is probably as close to RDR2 as I've been to feeling invested in characters.

The game's praised to death unfortunately at this age I can't really finish the game myself. Like many have pointed out. The game's too slow. GTA style combat but with old western guns feels sluggish. Arthur moves like a tank. Aiming sucks even with aim assist weirdly enough. Deadeye was just there so it'll suck less. Hand to hand combat is like a really bad UFC game lol. Just gotta tackle em and pouncd em Brock Lesnar style. I ended up watching story spoilers on YouTube.I'm lucky enough to have finished RDR1 back in the day and I think the story was better.
